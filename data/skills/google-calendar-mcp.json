  "readme": "# Google Calendar MCP Server\n\nA Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides Google Calendar integration for AI assistants like Claude.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-Account Support**: Connect multiple Google accounts (e.g., work, personal) and query them simultaneously\n- **Multi-Calendar Support**: List events from multiple calendars in a single request\n- **Cross-Account Conflicts**: Detect overlapping events across any combination of calendars\n- **Event Management**: Create, update, delete, and search calendar events\n- **Recurring Events**: Advanced modification capabilities for recurring events\n- **Free/Busy Queries**: Check availability across calendars\n- **Smart Scheduling**: Natural language understanding for dates and times\n- **Intelligent Import**: Add calendar events from images, PDFs, or web links\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A Google Cloud project with the Calendar API enabled\n2. OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)\n\n### Google Cloud Setup\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)\n2. Create a new project or select an existing one.\n3. Enable the [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com) for your project. Ensure that the right project is selected from the top bar before enabling the API.\n4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:\n   - Go to Credentials\n   - Click \"Create Credentials\" > \"OAuth client ID\"\n   - Choose \"User data\" for the type of data that the app will be accessing\n   - Add your app name and contact information\n   - Add the following scopes (optional):\n     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`\n   - Select \"Desktop app\" as the application type (Important!)\n   - Save the auth key, you'll need to add its path to the JSON in the next step\n   - Add your email address as a test user under the [Audience screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)\n      - Note: it might take a few minutes for the test user to be added. The OAuth consent will not allow you to proceed until the test user has propagated.\n      - Note about test mode: While an app is in test mode the auth tokens will expire after 1 week and need to be refreshed (see Re-authentication section below).\n\n### Installation\n\n**Option 1: Use with npx (Recommended)**\n\nAdd to your Claude Desktop configuration:\n\n**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`\n**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-calendar\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"@cocal/google-calendar-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS\": \"/path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**⚠️ Important Note for npx Users**: When using npx, you **must** specify the credentials file path using the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n**Option 2: Local Installation**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp.git\ncd google-calendar-mcp\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen add to Claude Desktop config using the local path or by specifying the path with the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.\n\n**Option 3: Docker Installation**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp.git\ncd google-calendar-mcp\ncp /path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json .\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nSee the [Docker deployment guide](docs/docker.md) for detailed configuration options including HTTP transport mode.\n\n### First Run\n\n1. Start Claude Desktop\n2. The server will prompt for authentication on first use\n3. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser\n4. You're ready to use calendar features!\n\n### Re-authentication\n\nIf you're in test mode (default), tokens expire after 7 days. If you are using a client like Claude Desktop it should open up a browser window to automatically re-auth. However, if you see authentication errors you can also resolve by following these steps:\n\n**For npx users:**\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/gcp-oauth.keys.json\"\nnpx @cocal/google-calendar-mcp auth\n```\n\n**For local installation:**\n```bash\nnpm run auth\n```\n\n**To avoid weekly re-authentication**, publish your app to production mode (without verification):\n1. Go to Google Cloud Console → \"APIs & Services\" → \"OAuth consent screen\"\n2. Click \"PUBLISH APP\" and confirm\n3. Your tokens will no longer expire after 7 days but Google will show a warning about the app being unverified. \n\nSee [Authentication Guide](docs/authentication.md#avoiding-token-expiration) for details.\n\n## Managing Multiple Accounts\n\nConnect multiple Google accounts and use them simultaneously.\n\n**In chat (recommended):** Use the `manage-accounts` tool to add, list, or remove accounts directly from your AI assistant - no terminal needed. See the [Authentication Guide](docs/authentication.md#managing-multiple-accounts) for details.\n\n**CLI:** For initial setup, use `npm run account auth <nickname>` (e.g., `npm run account auth work`).\n\n**HTTP / Docker:** Visit `http://localhost:3000/accounts` to manage accounts in the browser.\n\nWhen no `account` parameter is supplied to a tool, read-only tools merge results from all accounts, while write tools auto-select the account with appropriate permissions.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nAlong with the normal capabilities you would expect for a calendar integration you can also do really dynamic, multi-step processes like:\n\n1. **Cross-calendar availability**:\n   ```\n   Please provide availability looking at both my personal and work calendar for this upcoming week.\n   I am looking for a good time to meet with someone in London for 1 hr.\n   ```\n\n2. Add events from screenshots, images and other data sources:\n   ```\n   Add this event to my calendar based on the attached screenshot.\n   ```\n   Supported image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF\n   Images can contain event details like date, time, location, and description\n\n3. Calendar analysis:\n   ```\n   What events do I have coming up this week that aren't part of my usual routine?\n   ```\n4. Check attendance:\n   ```\n   Which events tomorrow have attendees who have not accepted the invitation?\n   ```\n5. Respond to invitations:\n   ```\n   Accept the team meeting invitation on my calendar for tomorrow at 2pm\n   ```\n   Decline with a note:\n   ```\n   Decline the Friday meeting with a note that I have a scheduling conflict\n   ```\n   Respond to recurring events:\n   ```\n   Accept just this week's standup, but keep future instances as tentative\n   ```\n   ```\n   Decline all future Monday planning meetings\n   ```\n6. Auto coordinate events:\n   ```\n   Here's some availability that was provided to me by someone. {available times}\n   Take a look at the times provided and let me know which ones are open on my calendar.\n   ```\n\n## Available Tools\n\n| Tool | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `list-calendars` | List all available calendars |\n| `list-events` | List events with date filtering |\n| `get-event` | Get details of a specific event by ID |\n| `search-events` | Search events by text query |\n| `create-event` | Create new calendar events |\n| `update-event` | Update existing events |\n| `delete-event` | Delete events |\n| `respond-to-event` | Respond to event invitations (Accept, Decline, Maybe, No Response) |\n| `get-freebusy` | Check availability across calendars, including external calendars |\n| `get-current-time` | Get current date and time in calendar's timezone |\n| `list-colors` | List available event colors |\n| `manage-accounts` | Add, list, or remove connected Google accounts |\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Authentication Setup](docs/authentication.md) - Detailed Google Cloud setup\n- [Advanced Usage](docs/advanced-usage.md) - Multi-account, batch operations\n- [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md) - HTTP transport, remote access\n- [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md) - Docker deployment with stdio and HTTP modes\n- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - Technical architecture overview\n- [Development](docs/development.md) - Contributing and testing\n- [Testing](docs/testing.md) - Unit and integration testing guide\n- [Multi-Account Updates](docs/multi-account-updates.md) - Current status and roadmap for multi-account support\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS` - Path to OAuth credentials file\n- `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_MCP_TOKEN_PATH` - Custom token storage location (optional)\n\n## Security\n\n- OAuth tokens are stored securely in your system's config directory\n- Credentials never leave your local machine\n- All calendar operations require explicit user consent\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n1. **OAuth Credentials File Not Found:**\n   - For npx users: You **must** specify the credentials file path using `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS`\n   - Verify file paths are absolute and accessible\n\n2. **Authentication Errors:**\n   - Ensure your credentials file contains credentials for a **Desktop App** type\n   - Verify your user email is added as a **Test User** in the Google Cloud OAuth Consent screen\n   - Try deleting saved tokens and re-authenticating\n   - Check that no other process is blocking ports 3000-3004\n\n3. **Build Errors:**\n   - Run `npm install && npm run build` again\n   - Check Node.js version (use LTS)\n   - Delete the `build/` directory and run `npm run build`\n4. **\"Something went wrong\" screen during browser authentication**\n   - Run the auth command manually (see [Re-authentication](#re-authentication) above)\n   - Use a Chromium-based browser. Test app authentication may not work on some non-Chromium browsers.\n\n5. **\"User Rate Limit Exceeded\" errors**\n   - This typically occurs when your OAuth credentials are missing project information\n   - Ensure your `gcp-oauth.keys.json` file includes `project_id`\n   - Re-download credentials from Google Cloud Console if needed\n   - The file should have format: `{\"installed\": {\"project_id\": \"your-project-id\", ...}}`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Support\n\n- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nspady/google-calendar-mcp/issues)\n- [Documentation](docs/)\n",
