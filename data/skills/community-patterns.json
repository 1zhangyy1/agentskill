  "readme": "# Community Patterns\n\n## ⚠️ WARNING: Early Development - Not Ready for Most Users\n\n**This project is in active, rapid development.** The framework underneath changes constantly, often breaking existing patterns without warning. Documentation is sparse, incomplete, and frequently outdated.\n\n### What You're Getting Into\n\n- **Breaking changes daily**: APIs change, patterns stop working, no migration guides\n- **Minimal documentation**: Most learning happens by reading code and asking questions\n- **Frustrating iteration cycles**: Compile errors with unclear messages, runtime behavior that doesn't match expectations\n- **Tool instability**: Development tools are experimental and may have bugs or missing features\n- **Time investment**: Expect to spend significant time debugging issues that aren't your fault\n\n### This Is For You If:\n\n- ✅ You're comfortable with unstable, rapidly-changing APIs\n- ✅ You enjoy debugging obscure framework issues\n- ✅ You're excited to contribute to early-stage development\n- ✅ You can tolerate wasted hours when things break\n- ✅ You don't need your patterns to keep working long-term\n\n### This Is NOT For You If:\n\n- ❌ You want a stable, well-documented framework\n- ❌ You need patterns that continue working over time\n- ❌ You expect responsive support or detailed guides\n- ❌ You're easily frustrated by broken tools\n- ❌ You're looking for a production-ready system\n\n**Still interested?** You've been warned. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) if you're ready to proceed.\n",
