  "readme": "# RAS Commander (ras-commander)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"ras-commander_logo.svg\" width=70%>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nRAS Commander is a Python library for automating HEC-RAS operations, providing a set of tools to interact with HEC-RAS project files, execute simulations, and manage project data. This library was initially conceptualized in the Australian Water School course \"AI Tools for Modelling Innovation\", and subsequently expanded to cover much of the basic functionality of the HECRASController COM32 interface using open-source python libraries.  This library uses a Test Driven Development strategy, leveraging the publicly-available HEC-RAS Example projects to create repeatable demonstration examples.  The \"Commmander\" moniker is inspired by the \"Command Line is All You Need\" approach to HEC-RAS automation that was first implemented in the HEC-Commander Tools repository.\r\n\r\n## LLM Forward Engineering\r\n\r\nThis library was developed using an **LLM Forward** approach - focusing on Large Language Models to accelerate engineering workflows while maintaining professional responsibility and verifiability. See [LLM Forward Development](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/llm-development/) for philosophy and best practices.\r\n\r\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ras-commander/badge/?version=latest)](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\r\n\r\n**[📖 Full Documentation](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/)** | *[ASFPM Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kX0twae8NrpLwR0iQ0Dmd8zAXdq-pYXD/view)*\r\n\r\n## Repository Author\r\n\r\n**[William Katzenmeyer, P.E., C.F.M.](https://engineeringwithllms.info)**\r\nOwner & Vice President, [CLB Engineering Corporation](https://clbengineering.com/)\r\n\r\nThis library demonstrates the **LLM Forward** approach to engineering software development - a framework emphasizing professional responsibility first while leveraging large language models to accelerate insight and automation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Don't Ask Me, Ask a GPT!\r\n\r\nThis repository has several methods of interaction with Large Language Models and LLM-Assisted Coding built right in:\r\n\r\n1. **[Claude Code Agentic Infrastructure](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/tree/main/.claude)**: A comprehensive cognitive infrastructure built for [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI tool. The `.claude/` directory contains specialized **agents** (domain experts for HDF analysis, geometry parsing, USGS integration, remote execution), **skills** (workflow templates for common tasks like plan execution and results extraction), **rules** (auto-loaded coding patterns and best practices), and **commands** (slash commands for common operations). The root `CLAUDE.md` provides strategic guidance while `AGENTS.md` files throughout the codebase offer scoped context. This hierarchical knowledge system enables Claude Code to understand ras-commander's static class patterns, HEC-RAS domain concepts, and testing approaches - making it an effective pair programming partner for hydraulic engineering automation. Just open the repository in Claude Code (`claude` in terminal) to leverage the full infrastructure.\r\n\r\n2. **[Purpose-Built Knowledge Base Summaries](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/tree/main/ai_tools/llm_knowledge_bases)**: Up-to-date compilations of the documentation and codebase for use with large language models like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini or Grok. Look in 'ai_tools/assistant_knowledge_bases/' in the repo.  The repo's codebase (without documentation and examples) has been curated to stay within the current ~200k context window limitations of frontier models, and for tasks that do not need an understanding of the underlying code, the Comprehensive Library Guide and any relevant examples from the example folder should be adequate context for leveraging the ras-commander API to complete tasks. \r\n\r\n3. **[Cursor IDE Integration](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/blob/main/.cursorrules)**: Custom rules(.cursor/rules) for the Cursor IDE to provide context-aware suggestions and documentation.  Just open the repository folder in Cursor to recognize these instructions.  You can create your own folders \"/workspace/, \"/projects/\", or \"my_projects/\" as these are already in the .gitignore, and place your custom scripts there for your projects.  This will allow easy referencing of the ras-commander documents and individual repo files, the automatic loading of the .cursorrules file.  Alternatvely, download the github repo into your projects folder to easily load documents and use cursor rules files.\r\n\r\n4. **[RAS-Commander library as indexed by Deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander)** An LLM-generated summary of the repostiory with diagrams and analysis of the library, as well as an integrated chat assistant with deep research.\r\n\r\n5. **[RAS Commander Library Assistant on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TZRPR3oAO-ras-commander-library-assistant)**: A specialized ChatGPT \"GPT\" with access to the ras-commander codebase and library, available for answering queries and providing code suggestions.   You can even upload your own plan, unsteady and HDF files to inspect and help determine how to automate your workflows or visualize your results.  _NOTE: GPT's are still quite limited by OpenAI's GPT frameworks and may not be useful for long conversations.  Code interpreter cannot run HEC-RAS but can [open and view smaller HDF files and projects for demonstration purposes](https://chatgpt.com/share/67e7cdb7-49e0-8010-bbac-61d2c54d473f)_\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe ras-commander library emerged from the initial test-bed of LLM Forward engineering represented by the [HEC-Commander tools](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/HEC-Commander) Python notebooks. These notebooks served as a proof of concept, demonstrating the value proposition of automating HEC-RAS operations through responsible LLM adoption.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, William Katzenmeyer taught a series of progressively more complex webinars demonstrating how to use simple prompting, example projects, and natural language instruction to effectively code HEC-RAS automation workflows, culminating in a 6-hour course. The library published for utilization in that course, [awsrastools](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/awsrastools), served as a foundation of examples which were iteratively extended into the full RAS-Commander library using LLM Forward development principles.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original notebook by the same name, this library is not focused on parallel execution across multiple machines. Instead, it is focused on providing a general-purpose python API for interacting with HEC-RAS projects, and building an AI-friendly library that will allow new users to quickly scaffold their own workflows into a python script. Example notebooks are provided, but the intention is to empower engineers, software developers, GIS personnel and data analysts to more easily access and interact with HEC-RAS data in a python environment. Also, by publishing these examples publicly, with complete working code examples and LLM optimization, future users can readily rewrite the key functions of the library for inclusion into their own preferred libraries, languages or return formats.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nIf you've ever read the book \"Breaking the HEC-RAS Code\" by Chris Goodell, this library is intended to be an AI-coded, pythonic library that provides a modern alternative to the HECRASController API.  By leveraginging modern python features libraries such as pandas, geopandas and H5Py (favoring HDF data sources wherever practicable) this library builds functionality around HEC-RAS 6.2+ while maintaining as much forward compatibilty as possible with HEC-RAS 2025.  \r\n\r\nHEC-RAS Project Management & Execution\r\n- Multi-project handling with parallel and sequential execution\r\n- Command-line execution integration\r\n- Project folder management and organization\r\n- Multi-core processing optimization\r\n- Progress tracking and logging\r\n- Execution error handling and recovery\r\n\r\nLegacy Version Support (NEW in v0.81.0)\r\n- **RasControl class** for HEC-RAS 3.x-4.x via COM interface (HECRASController)\r\n- ras-commander style API - use plan numbers, not file paths\r\n- Extract steady state profiles AND unsteady time series\r\n- Run plans with automatic current plan setting\r\n- Supports versions: 3.1, 4.1, 5.0.x (501-507), 6.0, 6.3, 6.6\r\n- Version migration validation and comparison\r\n- Open-operate-close pattern prevents conflicts with modern workflows\r\n- Seamless integration with ras-commander project management\r\n- See `examples/17_legacy_1d_automation_with_hecrascontroller_and_rascontrol.ipynb` for complete usage\r\n\r\nHDF Data Access & Analysis\r\n- 2D mesh results processing (depths, velocities, WSE)\r\n- Cross-section data extraction\r\n- Boundary condition analysis\r\n- Structure data (bridges, culverts, gates)\r\n- Pipe network and pump station analysis\r\n- Fluvial-pluvial boundary calculations\r\n- Infiltration and precipitation data handling\r\n- Infiltration and soil data handling\r\n- Land cover and terrain data integration\r\n- Weighted parameter calculations for hydrologic modeling\r\n\r\nRASMapper Data Integration\r\n- RASMapper configuration parsing (.rasmap files)\r\n- Terrain, soil, and land cover HDF paths\r\n- Profile line paths\r\n\r\nManning's n Coefficient Management\r\n- Base Manning's n table extraction and modification\r\n- Regional overrides for spatially-varied roughness\r\n- Direct editing of geometry file Manning values\r\n\r\nInfiltration & Soil Analysis\r\n- Soil statistics calculation and analysis\r\n- Infiltration parameter management and scaling\r\n- Weighted average parameter calculation\r\n- Raster-based soil data processing\r\n\r\nRAS ASCII File Operations\r\n- Plan file creation and modification\r\n- Geometry file parsing examples \r\n- Unsteady flow file management\r\n- Project file updates and validation  \r\n\r\nNote about support for Pipe Networks:  As a relatively new feature, only read access to Pipe Network geometry and results data has been included.  Users will need to code their own methods to modify/add pipe network data, and pull requests are always welcome to incorporate this capability.\r\n\r\nNote about version support: The modern HDF-based features target HEC-RAS 6.2+ for optimal compatibility. For legacy versions (3.1, 4.1, 5.0.x), use the RasControl class which provides COM-based access to steady state profile extraction and plan execution (see example notebook 17).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst, create a virtual environment with conda or venv (ask ChatGPT if you need help).  \r\n\r\n#### Install via Pip\r\n\r\nIn your virtual environment, install ras-commander using pip:\r\n```\r\npip install --upgrade ras-commander\r\n```\r\nIf you have dependency issues with pip (especially if you have errors with numpy), try clearing your local pip packages 'C:\\Users\\your_username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\' and then creating a new virtual environment.  \r\n\r\n### Library Dependencies\r\n\r\nThese are the core dependencies required for ras-commander library functionality:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Core library dependencies\r\npip install h5py numpy pandas requests tqdm scipy xarray geopandas matplotlib shapely rasterstats rtree\r\n\r\n# Windows-specific (for RasControl COM interface and GUI automation)\r\npip install pywin32 psutil\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notebook Dependencies\r\n\r\nAdditional packages needed to run the example notebooks in the `examples/` folder:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# For raster visualization (notebooks 15, 21)\r\npip install rasterio\r\n\r\n# For coordinate system operations (notebook 14)\r\npip install pyproj\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Optional Dependencies\r\n\r\nFor specific features that aren't required for core functionality:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# DSS file operations (requires Java JRE/JDK 8+)\r\npip install pyjnius\r\n\r\n# Remote execution backends\r\npip install paramiko      # SSH remote execution\r\npip install pywinrm       # WinRM remote execution\r\npip install docker        # Docker container execution\r\npip install boto3         # AWS EC2 execution\r\npip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-compute  # Azure execution\r\n\r\n# Or install all remote backends at once:\r\npip install ras-commander[remote-all]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `pathlib` is built into Python 3.4+ and does not need to be installed separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Work in a Local Copy\r\n\r\nIf you want to make revisions and work actively in your local version of ras-commander, just skip the pip install rascommander step above and clone a fork of the repo to your local machine using Git (ask ChatGPT if you need help).  Most of the notebooks and examples in this repo have a code segment similar to the one below, that works as long as the script is located in a first-level subfolder of the ras-commander repository:\r\n```\r\n# Flexible imports to allow for development without installation\r\ntry:\r\n    # Try to import from the installed package\r\n    from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasExamples, RasCmdr, RasPlan, RasGeo, RasUnsteady, RasUtils, ras\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    # If the import fails, add the parent directory to the Python path\r\n    current_file = Path(__file__).resolve()\r\n    parent_directory = current_file.parent.parent\r\n    sys.path.append(str(parent_directory))\r\n    # Alternately, you can just define a path sys.path.append(r\"c:/path/to/rascommander/rascommander)\")\r\n    \r\n    # Now try to import again\r\n    from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasExamples, RasCmdr, RasPlan, RasGeo, RasUnsteady, RasUtils, ras\r\n```\r\nIt is highly suggested to fork this repository before going this route, and using Git to manage your changes!  This allows any revisions to the ras-commander classes and functions to be actively edited and developed by end users. The folders \"/workspace/, \"/projects/\", or \"my_projects/\" are included in the .gitignore, so users can place you custom scripts there for any project data they don't want to be tracked by git.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start Guide\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasCmdr, RasPlan\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Initialize a project (single project)\r\n```python\r\n# Basic initialization using default HEC-RAS location (on C: drive)\r\ninit_ras_project(r\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\r\n\r\n# Specifying a custom path to Ras.exe (useful if HEC-RAS is not installed on C: drive)\r\ninit_ras_project(r\"/path/to/project\", r\"D:/Programs/HEC/HEC-RAS/6.5/Ras.exe\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Initialize a project (multiple projects)\r\n```python\r\nyour_ras_project = RasPrj()\r\ninit_ras_project(r\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\", ras_object=your_ras_project)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Accessing Plan, Unsteady and Boundary Conditions Dataframes\r\nUsing the default 'ras\" object, othewise substitute your_ras_project for muli-project scripts\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nPlan Files DataFrame:\")\r\nras.plan_df\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nFlow Files DataFrame:\")\r\nras.flow_df\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nUnsteady Flow Files DataFrame:\")\r\nras.unsteady_df\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nGeometry Files DataFrame:\")\r\nras.geom_df\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nBoundary Conditions DataFrame:\")\r\nras.boundaries_df\r\n```\r\n```\r\nprint(\"\\nHDF Entries DataFrame:\")\r\nras.get_hdf_entries()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Execute a single plan\r\n```\r\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", dest_folder=r\"/path/to/results\", overwrite_dest=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Execute plans in parallel\r\n```\r\nresults = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(\r\n    plan_number=[\"01\", \"02\"],\r\n    max_workers=2,\r\n    num_cores=2,\r\n    dest_folder=r\"/path/to/results\",\r\n    overwrite_dest=True\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modify a plan\r\n```\r\nRasPlan.set_geom(\"01\", \"02\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Execution Modes\r\n\r\nRAS Commander provides multiple methods for executing HEC-RAS plans:\r\n\r\n#### Modern Command-Line Execution (HEC-RAS 6.0+)\r\n\r\n**Single Plan Execution:**\r\n```python\r\n# Execute a single plan\r\nsuccess = RasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", dest_folder=r\"/path/to/results\")\r\nprint(f\"Plan execution {'successful' if success else 'failed'}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Sequential Execution of Multiple Plans:**\r\n```python\r\n# Execute multiple plans in sequence in a test folder\r\nresults = RasCmdr.compute_test_mode(\r\n    plan_number=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\"],\r\n    dest_folder_suffix=\"[Test]\"\r\n)\r\nfor plan, success in results.items():\r\n    print(f\"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans:**\r\n```python\r\n# Execute multiple plans concurrently\r\nresults = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(\r\n    plan_number=[\"01\", \"02\", \"03\"],\r\n    max_workers=3,\r\n    num_cores=2\r\n)\r\nfor plan, success in results.items():\r\n    print(f\"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Legacy COM Interface Execution (HEC-RAS 3.x-6.x)\r\n\r\n**For older HEC-RAS versions**, use the RasControl class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Initialize with version\r\ninit_ras_project(project_path, \"4.1\")  # or \"41\", \"5.0.6\", \"506\", \"6.6\", etc.\r\n\r\n# Run a plan (auto-sets as current, blocks until complete)\r\nsuccess, messages = RasControl.run_plan(\"02\")\r\n\r\n# Extract steady state results\r\ndf_steady = RasControl.get_steady_results(\"02\")\r\nprint(f\"Extracted {len(df_steady)} rows with {df_steady['profile'].nunique()} profiles\")\r\n\r\n# Extract unsteady time series (includes \"Max WS\" special timestep)\r\ndf_unsteady = RasControl.get_unsteady_results(\"01\", max_times=20)\r\ntimes = RasControl.get_output_times(\"01\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key RasControl Features:**\r\n- Uses plan numbers, not file paths (ras-commander style)\r\n- Automatically sets current plan before operations\r\n- Supports steady AND unsteady extraction\r\n- Works with versions 3.1, 4.1, 5.0.x, 6.0, 6.3, 6.6\r\n- Open-operate-close pattern (no HEC-RAS window left open)\r\n- Perfect for version migration validation\r\n\r\n### Working with Multiple Projects\r\n\r\nRAS Commander allows working with multiple HEC-RAS projects simultaneously:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Initialize multiple projects\r\nproject1 = RasPrj()\r\ninit_ras_project(path1, \"6.6\", ras_object=project1)\r\nproject2 = RasPrj()\r\ninit_ras_project(path2, \"6.6\", ras_object=project2)\r\n\r\n# Perform operations on each project\r\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", ras_object=project1, dest_folder=folder1)\r\nRasCmdr.compute_plan(\"01\", ras_object=project2, dest_folder=folder2)\r\n\r\n# Compare results between projects\r\nprint(f\"Project 1: {project1.project_name}\")\r\nprint(f\"Project 2: {project2.project_name}\")\r\n\r\n# Always specify the ras_object parameter when working with multiple projects\r\n# to avoid confusion with the global 'ras' object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is useful for comparing different river systems, running scenario analyses across multiple watersheds, or managing a suite of related models.\r\n\r\n#### Core HEC-RAS Automation Classes\r\n\r\n- `RasPrj`: Manages HEC-RAS projects, handling initialization and data loading\r\n- `RasCmdr`: Handles execution of HEC-RAS simulations via command line\r\n- `RasControl`: Legacy version support via COM interface for HEC-RAS 3.x-6.x\r\n- `RasPlan`: Provides functions for modifying and updating plan files\r\n- `RasGeo`: Handles 2D Manning's n land cover operations\r\n- `RasGeometry`: **NEW** Comprehensive 1D geometry parsing (cross sections, storage, connections)\r\n- `RasGeometryUtils`: **NEW** Geometry parsing utilities (FORTRAN fixed-width, count interpretation)\r\n- `RasBreach`: Dam breach parameter modification in plan files\r\n- `RasUnsteady`: Manages unsteady flow file operations\r\n- `RasUtils`: Contains utility functions for file operations and data management\r\n- `RasMap`: Parses RASMapper configuration files and automates floodplain mapping\r\n- `RasExamples`: Manages and loads HEC-RAS example projects\r\n\r\n#### HDF Data Access Classes\r\n- `HdfBase`: Core functionality for HDF file operations\r\n- `HdfBndry`: Enhanced boundary condition handling\r\n- `HdfMesh`: Comprehensive mesh data management\r\n- `HdfPlan`: Plan data extraction and analysis\r\n- `HdfResultsMesh`: Advanced mesh results processing\r\n- `HdfResultsPlan`: Plan results analysis\r\n- `HdfResultsXsec`: Cross-section results processing\r\n- `HdfStruc`: Structure data and SA/2D connection management\r\n- `HdfResultsBreach`: **NEW** Dam breach results extraction from HDF files\r\n- `HdfHydraulicTables`: **NEW** Cross section property tables (HTAB) for rating curves\r\n- `HdfPipe`: Pipe network analysis tools\r\n- `HdfPump`: Pump station analysis capabilities\r\n- `HdfFluvialPluvial`: Fluvial-pluvial boundary analysis\r\n- `HdfPlot` & `HdfResultsPlot`: Specialized plotting utilities\r\n\r\n### Project Organization Diagram\r\n\r\n```\r\nras_commander\r\n├── ai_tools\r\n│   └── [AI Knowledge Bases](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/tree/main/ai_tools/llm_knowledge_bases)\r\n├── examples\r\n│   └── [Examples Notebooks](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/tree/main/ras_commander)\r\n├── ras_commander\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   ├── _version.py\r\n│   ├── Decorators.py\r\n│   ├── LoggingConfig.py\r\n│   ├── RasCmdr.py\r\n│   ├── RasExamples.py\r\n│   ├── RasGeo.py\r\n│   ├── RasPlan.py\r\n│   ├── RasPrj.py\r\n│   ├── RasUnsteady.py\r\n│   ├── RasUtils.py\r\n│   ├── HdfBase.py\r\n│   ├── HdfBndry.py\r\n│   ├── HdfMesh.py\r\n│   ├── HdfPlan.py\r\n│   ├── HdfResultsMesh.py\r\n│   ├── HdfResultsPlan.py\r\n│   ├── HdfResultsXsec.py\r\n│   ├── HdfStruc.py\r\n│   ├── HdfPipe.py\r\n│   ├── HdfPump.py\r\n│   ├── HdfFluvialPluvial.py\r\n│   ├── HdfPlot.py\r\n│   └── HdfResultsPlot.py\r\n├── docs/                   #

This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.  All examples in the ras-commander repository currently utilize HEC example projects to provide fully running scripts and notebooks for end user testing, demonstration and adaption. \r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n- Download and extract HEC-RAS example projects\r\n- List available project categories and projects\r\n- Extract specific projects for use\r\n- Manage example project data efficiently\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\nfrom ras_commander import RasExamples\r\n\r\n```\r\ncategories = ras_examples.list_categories()\r\nprojects = ras_examples.list_projects(\"Steady Flow\")\r\nextracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project([\"Bald Eagle Creek\", \"Muncie\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe RasExamples class is used to provide an alternative to traditional unit testing, with example notebooks doubling as tests and in-context examples for the end user.  This increases interpretability by LLM's, reducing hallucinations.  \r\n\r\n### RasPrj\r\n\r\nThe `RasPrj` class is central to managing HEC-RAS projects within the ras-commander library. It handles project initialization, data loading, and provides access to project components.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n- Initialize HEC-RAS projects\r\n- Load and manage project data (plans, geometries, flows, etc.)\r\n- Provide easy access to project files and information\r\n\r\nNote: While a global `ras` object is available for convenience, you can create multiple `RasPrj` instances to manage several projects simultaneously.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\nfrom ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using the global ras object\r\n```\r\ninit_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Creating a custom RasPrj instance\r\n```\r\ncustom_project = RasPrj()\r\ninit_ras_project(\"/path/to/another_project\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=custom_project)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### RasHdf\r\n\r\nThe `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF files in HEC-RAS projects, enabling easy access to simulation results and model data.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom ras_commander import RasHdf, init_ras_project, RasPrj\r\n\r\n# Initialize project with a custom ras object\r\ncustom_ras = RasPrj()\r\ninit_ras_project(\"/path/to/project\", \"6.5\", ras_instance=custom_ras)\r\n\r\n# Get runtime data for a specific plan\r\nplan_number = \"01\"\r\nruntime_data = RasHdf.get_runtime_data(plan_number, ras_object=custom_ras)\r\nprint(runtime_data)\r\n```\r\nThis class simplifies the process of extracting and analyzing data from HEC-RAS HDF output files, supporting tasks such as post-processing and result visualization.\r\n\r\n#### Infrastructure Analysis\r\n```python\r\nfrom ras_commander import HdfPipe, HdfPump\r\n\r\n# Analyze pipe network\r\npipe_network = HdfPipe.get_pipe_network(hdf_path)\r\nconduits = HdfPipe.get_pipe_conduits(hdf_path)\r\n\r\n# Analyze pump stations\r\npump_stations = HdfPump.get_pump_stations(hdf_path)\r\npump_performance = HdfPump.get_pump_station_summary(hdf_path)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Advanced Results Analysis\r\n```python\r\nfrom ras_commander import HdfResultsMesh\r\n\r\n# Get maximum water surface and velocity\r\nmax_ws = HdfResultsMesh.get_mesh_max_ws(hdf_path)\r\nmax_vel = HdfResultsMesh.get_mesh_max_face_v(hdf_path)\r\n\r\n# Visualize results\r\nfrom ras_commander import HdfResultsPlot\r\nHdfResultsPlot.plot_results_max_wsel(max_ws)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Fluvial-Pluvial Analysis\r\n```python\r\nfrom ras_commander import HdfFluvialPluvial\r\n\r\nboundary = HdfFluvialPluvial.calculate_fluvial_pluvial_boundary(\r\n    hdf_path,\r\n    delta_t=12  # Time threshold in hours\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nCheck out the examples in the repository to learn how to use RAS Commander:\r\n\r\n### Project Setup\r\n- `00_Using_RasExamples.ipynb`: Download and extract HEC-RAS example projects\r\n- `01_project_initialization.ipynb`: Initialize HEC-RAS projects and explore their components\r\n\r\n### File Operations\r\n- `02_plan_and_geometry_operations.ipynb`: Clone and modify plan and geometry files\r\n- `03_unsteady_flow_operations.ipynb`: Extract and modify boundary conditions\r\n- `09_plan_parameter_operations.ipynb`: Retrieve and update plan parameters\r\n\r\n### Execution Modes\r\n- `05_single_plan_execution.ipynb`: Execute a single plan with specific options\r\n- `06_executing_plan_sets.ipynb`: Different ways to specify and execute plan sets\r\n- `07_sequential_plan_execution.ipynb`: Run multiple plans in sequence\r\n- `08_parallel_execution.ipynb`: Run multiple plans in parallel\r\n\r\n### Legacy Version Support\r\n- `17_legacy_1d_automation_with_hecrascontroller_and_rascontrol.ipynb`: Using RasControl for HEC-RAS 3.x-6.x via COM interface\r\n\r\n### Advanced Operations\r\n- `04_multiple_project_operations.ipynb`: Work with multiple HEC-RAS projects simultaneously\r\n\r\nThese examples demonstrate practical applications of RAS Commander for automating HEC-RAS workflows, from basic operations to advanced scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nFor detailed usage instructions and API documentation, visit the **[RAS Commander Documentation](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/)**:\r\n\r\n- [Installation Guide](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation/)\r\n- [Quick Start](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/quickstart/)\r\n- [User Guide](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/overview/)\r\n- [API Reference](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/)\r\n\r\n## Future Development\r\n\r\nThe ras-commander library is an ongoing project embodying LLM Forward engineering principles.

The initial development of this library was presented in the HEC-Commander Tools repository. In a 2024 Australian Water School webinar, Bill demonstrated the derivation of basic HEC-RAS automation functions from plain language instructions. Leveraging the previously developed code and AI tools, the library was created. The primary tools used for this initial development were Anthropic's Claude, GPT-4, Google's Gemini Experimental models, and the Cursor AI Coding IDE.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we would like to acknowledge the following notable contributions and attributions for open source projects which significantly influenced the development of RAS Commander:\r\n\r\n1.
