  "readme": "# Claude Code Plugins Directory\n\nA curated directory of high-quality plugins for Claude Code.\n\n> **⚠️ Important:** Make sure you trust a plugin before installing, updating, or using it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they will work as intended or that they won't change. See each plugin's homepage for more information.\n\n## Structure\n\n- **`/plugins`** - Internal plugins developed and maintained by Anthropic\n- **`/external_plugins`** - Third-party plugins from partners and the community\n\n## Installation\n\nPlugins can be installed directly from this marketplace via Claude Code's plugin system.\n\nTo install, run `/plugin install {plugin-name}@claude-plugin-directory`\n\nor browse for the plugin in `/plugin > Discover`\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Internal Plugins\n\nInternal plugins are developed by Anthropic team members. See `/plugins/example-plugin` for a reference implementation.\n\n### External Plugins\n\nThird-party partners can submit plugins for inclusion in the marketplace. External plugins must meet quality and security standards for approval.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\nEach plugin follows a standard structure:\n\n```\nplugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── plugin.json      # Plugin metadata (required)\n├── .mcp.json            # MCP server configuration (optional)\n├── commands/            # Slash commands (optional)\n├── agents/              # Agent definitions (optional)\n├── skills/              # Skill definitions (optional)\n└── README.md            # Documentation\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on developing Claude Code plugins, see the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins).\n",
