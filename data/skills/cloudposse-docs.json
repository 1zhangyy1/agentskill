Here you'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with the Cloud Posse technology stack as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck.\n\nLet's jump right in! Here's how to get started with our documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Build dependencies\n```\nmake all\n```\n\n2. Start local web server\n```\nmake start\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Related Projects\n\nCheck out these related projects.\n\n- [Geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) - Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform\n\n\n\n## ✨ Contributing\n\nThis project is under active development, and we encourage contributions from our community.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to our outstanding contributors:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cloudposse/docs/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=cloudposse/docs&max=24\" />\n</a>\n\nFor 🐛 bug reports & feature requests, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cloudposse/docs/issues).\n\nIn general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical \"fork-and-pull\" Git workflow.\n 1. Review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cloudposse/docs/?tab=coc-ov-file#code-of-conduct) and [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/cloudposse/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n 2. **Fork** the repo on GitHub\n 3. **Clone** the project to your own machine\n 4. **Commit** changes to your own branch\n 5. **Push** your work back up to your fork\n 6. Submit a **Pull Request** so that we can review your changes\n\n**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest changes from \"upstream\" before making a pull request!\n\n\n## Running Terraform Tests\n\nWe use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.\n\nAll tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.\n\nUnder the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.\n\nSetup dependencies:\n- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))\n- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)\n- Install Terraform or OpenTofu\n\nTo run tests:\n\n- Run all tests:  \n  ```sh\n  atmos test run\n  ```\n- Clean up test artifacts:  \n  ```sh\n  atmos test clean\n  ```\n- Explore additional test options:  \n  ```sh\n  atmos test --help\n  ```\nThe configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.\n\nLearn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.\n\n### 🌎 Slack Community\n\nJoin our [Open Source Community](https://cpco.io/slack?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cloudposse/docs&utm_content=slack) on Slack.
