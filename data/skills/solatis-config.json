This document has been invaluable for understanding and applying advanced prompt engineering techniques. I later integrated additional prompting techniques, but this document has been invaluable to kick-starting my understanding of prompting techniques that work.\n\nWhen optimizing prompts with these techniques:\n\n```\nApply ALL prompt engineering patterns from `prompt-engineering.md` to this modification. For EACH change, specify EXACTLY which technique(s) you used:\n- Pattern name (e.g., \"Progressive Disclosure\", \"Emphasis Hierarchy\")\n- Why this pattern applies here\n- Expected behavioral impact\n\nCRITICAL: Changes without pattern attribution = task incomplete.\n```\n",
