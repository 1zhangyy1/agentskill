  "readme": "---\nname: csv-data-summarizer\ndescription: Analyzes CSV files, generates summary stats, and plots quick visualizations using Python and pandas.\nmetadata:\n  version: 2.1.0\n  dependencies: python>=3.8, pandas>=2.0.0, matplotlib>=3.7.0, seaborn>=0.12.0\n---\n\n# CSV Data Summarizer\n\nThis Skill analyzes CSV files and provides comprehensive summaries with statistical insights and visualizations.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nClaude should use this Skill whenever the user:\n- Uploads or references a CSV file\n- Asks to summarize, analyze, or visualize tabular data\n- Requests insights from CSV data\n- Wants to understand data structure and quality\n\n## How It Works\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENT ⚠️\n\n**DO NOT ASK THE USER WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE DATA.**\n**DO NOT OFFER OPTIONS OR CHOICES.**\n**DO NOT SAY \"What would you like me to help you with?\"**\n**DO NOT LIST POSSIBLE ANALYSES.**\n\n**IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY:**\n1. Run the comprehensive analysis\n2. Generate ALL relevant visualizations\n3. Present complete results\n4. NO questions, NO options, NO waiting for user input\n\n**THE USER WANTS A FULL ANALYSIS RIGHT AWAY - JUST DO IT.**\n\n### Automatic Analysis Steps:\n\n**The skill intelligently adapts to different data types and industries by inspecting the data first, then determining what analyses are most relevant.**\n\n1. **Load and inspect** the CSV file into pandas DataFrame\n2. **Identify data structure** - column types, date columns, numeric columns, categories\n3. **Determine relevant analyses** based on what's actually in the data:\n   - **Sales/E-commerce data** (order dates, revenue, products): Time-series trends, revenue analysis, product performance\n   - **Customer data** (demographics, segments, regions): Distribution analysis, segmentation, geographic patterns\n   - **Financial data** (transactions, amounts, dates): Trend analysis, statistical summaries, correlations\n   - **Operational data** (timestamps, metrics, status): Time-series, performance metrics, distributions\n   - **Survey data** (categorical responses, ratings): Frequency analysis, cross-tabulations, distributions\n   - **Generic tabular data**: Adapts based on column types found\n\n4. **Only create visualizations that make sense** for the specific dataset:\n   - Time-series plots ONLY if date/timestamp columns exist\n   - Correlation heatmaps ONLY if multiple numeric columns exist\n   - Category distributions ONLY if categorical columns exist\n   - Histograms for numeric distributions when relevant\n   \n5. **Generate comprehensive output** automatically including:\n   - Data overview (rows, columns, types)\n   - Key statistics and metrics relevant to the data type\n   - Missing data analysis\n   - Multiple relevant visualizations (only those that apply)\n   - Actionable insights based on patterns found in THIS specific dataset\n   \n6. **Present everything** in one complete analysis - no follow-up questions\n\n**Example adaptations:**\n- Healthcare data with patient IDs → Focus on demographics, treatment patterns, temporal trends\n- Inventory data with stock levels → Focus on quantity distributions, reorder patterns, SKU analysis  \n- Web analytics with timestamps → Focus on traffic patterns, conversion metrics, time-of-day analysis\n- Survey responses → Focus on response distributions, demographic breakdowns, sentiment patterns\n\n### Behavior Guidelines\n\n✅ **CORRECT APPROACH - SAY THIS:**\n- \"I'll analyze this data comprehensively right now.\"\n- \"Here's the complete analysis with visualizations:\"\n- \"I've identified this as [type] data and generated relevant insights:\"\n- Then IMMEDIATELY show the full analysis\n\n✅ **DO:**\n- Immediately run the analysis script\n- Generate ALL relevant charts automatically\n- Provide complete insights without being asked\n- Be thorough and complete in first response\n- Act decisively without asking permission\n\n❌ **NEVER SAY THESE PHRASES:**\n- \"What would you like to do with this data?\"\n- \"What would you like me to help you with?\"\n- \"Here are some common options:\"\n- \"Let me know what you'd like help with\"\n- \"I can create a comprehensive analysis if you'd like!\"\n- Any sentence ending with \"?\" asking for user direction\n- Any list of options or choices\n- Any conditional \"I can do X if you want\"\n\n❌ **FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**\n- Asking what the user wants\n- Listing options for the user to choose from\n- Waiting for user direction before analyzing\n- Providing partial analysis that requires follow-up\n- Describing what you COULD do instead of DOING it\n\n### Usage\n\nThe Skill provides a Python function `summarize_csv(file_path)` that:\n- Accepts a path to a CSV file\n- Returns a comprehensive text summary with statistics\n- Generates multiple visualizations automatically based on data structure\n\n### Example Prompts\n\n> \"Here's `sales_data.csv`. Can you summarize this file?\"\n\n> \"Analyze this customer data CSV and show me trends.\"\n\n> \"What insights can you find in `orders.csv`?\"\n\n### Example Output\n\n**Dataset Overview**\n- 5,000 rows × 8 columns  \n- 3 numeric columns, 1 date column  \n\n**Summary Statistics**\n- Average order value: $58.2  \n- Standard deviation: $12.4\n- Missing values: 2% (100 cells)\n\n**Insights**\n- Sales show upward trend over time\n- Peak activity in Q4\n*(Attached: trend plot)*\n\n## Files\n\n- `analyze.py` - Core analysis logic\n- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies\n- `resources/sample.csv` - Example dataset for testing\n- `resources/README.md` - Additional documentation\n\n## Notes\n\n- Automatically detects date columns (columns containing 'date' in name)\n- Handles missing data gracefully\n- Generates visualizations only when date columns are present\n- All numeric columns are included in statistical summary\n\n",
