  "readme": "# dotfiles [![tests](https://github.com/bendrucker/dotfiles/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bendrucker/dotfiles/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n\n> My dotfiles for configuring macOS\n\nLinux friendly, outside of [`macos/`](macos/) and a [`Brewfile`](Brewfile) for dependency management. I use this repo for both home and work.\n\nHighlights include:\n\n* zsh with the minimal [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt\n* Sane defaults for programming languages I use\n\n## Installing\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/bendrucker/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\ncd ~/.dotfiles\nscripts/bootstrap\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe project is organized into logical \"topic\" folders. Scripts are organized into topic folders according to functionality (e.g. HTTP utilities in `http/`) and may be organized by type (aliases, functions, etc.) within a topic folder.\n\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to `$PATH`.\n- **./\\**/Brewfile**: Defines packages to install via Homebrew, including Homebrew Cask for GUIs.\n- **\\*/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` are loaded.\n- **\\*/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is\n  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.\n- **\\*/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded\n  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.\n- **\\*/\\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into `$HOME` by `script/bootstrap`.\n\n## Prior Art\n\n* [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles): Boostrap/install scripts, initial ZSH config, colorization\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](license)\n",
