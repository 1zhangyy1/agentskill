Each skill contains instructions, scripts, and assets that enable Claude to perform complex multi-step operations autonomously.\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### 🍕 Family Menu Generator (`family-menu`)\nCreates beautiful, protein-focused weekly dinner menus for families with research capabilities.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Protein-focused meal planning\n- Leftover detection and planning\n- Local restaurant recommendations\n- Seasonal ingredient research\n- Random beautiful PDF designs (5 styles)\n- Homemade Pizza Fridays\n- Print-ready 8.5x11 PDFs\n\n**Use when:** Planning weekly family dinners, creating refrigerator menus, or meal planning assistance.\n\n### 💡 Brainstorming (`brainstorm-it`)\nRefines rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured Socratic questioning and alternative exploration.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Structured 4-phase ideation process\n- Current state assessment\n- Alternative approach exploration\n- Incremental design validation\n- Git worktree workflow integration\n- Implementation planning\n\n**Use when:** Creating or developing anything before writing code or implementation plans - transforms ideas into actionable designs.\n\n### 📄 Resume Builder (`resume-builder`)\nGenerate beautiful, professionally designed resumes as 1-2 page PDFs.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Clean, sophisticated layouts\n- Job-specific tailoring\n- Address verification workflow\n- Optional cover letter generation\n- Custom typography from included fonts\n- ATS-friendly formatting\n\n**Use when:** Creating professional resumes, tailoring applications to specific job postings, or generating matching cover letters.\n\n### 📊 Quarterly Connection Assistant (`quarterly-connect`)\nStrategic AI partner that guides employees through comprehensive quarterly performance reflections aligned with company values.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Automatic company core values research via web search\n- Structured 6-phase reflection process (wins, strengths, challenges, focus, career, feedback)\n- Evidence-based, outcome-focused narrative building\n- External success factor weighting (client impact, certifications, external learning)\n- Executive-ready quarterly connection reports\n- Quarter-aware date filtering (Q1-Q4)\n- Iterative refinement through Socratic questioning\n\n**Use when:** Preparing quarterly performance reviews, career development planning, manager 1:1 preparation, or tracking professional growth aligned with company values.\n\n### 📊 Template Slide Deck (`template-slide-deck`)\nGenerate professional presentations by applying content to company-provided PowerPoint templates.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Brand-consistent slide generation\n- Template layout analysis and mapping\n- Multiple content source support (text, documents, outlines)\n- Intelligent content-to-slide mapping\n- Visual validation workflow\n\n**Use when:** Creating presentations using company templates, generating branded slide decks, or building presentations that match organizational design standards.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use these skills with Claude Code:\n\n1. **Navigate to the skill directory** you want to install (e.g., `family-menu/`, `brainstorm-it/`, `resume-builder/`, `quarterly-connect/`, or `template-slide-deck/`)\n\n2. **Create a zip file** of the entire directory contents:\n   ```bash\n   # From the repository root\n   cd family-menu\n   zip -r ../family-menu.zip .\n   cd ..\n   ```\n\n   Or for all skills:\n   ```bash\n   # Create zip files for each skill\n   cd family-menu && zip -r ../family-menu.zip . && cd ..\n   cd brainstorm-it && zip -r ../brainstorm-it.zip . && cd ..\n   cd resume-builder && zip -r ../resume-builder.zip . && cd ..\n   cd quarterly-connect && zip -r ../quarterly-connect.zip . && cd ..\n   cd template-slide-deck && zip -r ../template-slide-deck.zip . && cd ..\n   ```\n\n3. **Upload to Claude Code:**\n   - Open Claude Code\n   - Navigate to the Skills section\n   - Click \"Add Skill\" or \"Upload Skill\"\n   - Select the `.zip` file you created\n   - Claude will automatically extract and load the skill\n\n## Skill Structure\n\nEach skill directory follows this structure:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions for Claude\n├── scripts/              # Python/bash scripts (if needed)\n├── assets/               # Fonts, images, templates (if needed)\n├── references/           # Documentation, examples (if needed)\n└── LICENSE.txt           # License information (if applicable)\n```\n\nThe `SKILL.md` file contains:\n- **Frontmatter**: Name, description, and metadata\n- **Instructions**: Detailed workflow and guidelines for Claude\n- **Resources**: Information about included scripts and assets\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed, skills are automatically available to Claude. Claude will recognize when to use each skill based on:\n\n- The skill's description in the frontmatter\n- Context clues in your conversation\n- Explicit requests (e.g., \"Use the brainstorming skill to help me design this feature\")\n\n## Development\n\n### Creating New Skills\n\n1. Create a new directory with your skill name\n2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and instructions\n3. Include any necessary scripts in a `scripts/` directory\n4. Add assets (fonts, templates, etc.) to an `assets/` directory\n5. Test the skill with Claude\n6. Zip the directory for distribution\n\n### Modifying Existing Skills\n\n1. Edit the appropriate `SKILL.md` or script files\n2. Re-zip the skill directory\n3. Re-upload to Claude Code (may need to remove old version first)\n\n## Requirements\n\nSkills may have different dependencies:\n\n- **Family Menu Generator**: Requires Python with `reportlab` library\n- **Brainstorm-it**: No external dependencies\n- **Resume Builder**: Requires Python with PDF generation libraries (e.g., `reportlab`)\n- **Quarterly Connection Assistant**: No external dependencies (uses built-in web search)\n- **Template Slide Deck**: Requires access to pptx skill and Python-based PowerPoint tools\n\nCheck each skill's `SKILL.md` or `README.md` for specific requirements.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to:\n- Report issues or suggest improvements\n- Create new skills following the existing patterns\n- Share your modified versions\n- Submit pull requests with enhancements\n\n## License\n\nEach skill may have its own license. Check the individual skill directories for license information.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** These skills are designed for Claude Code and require the Claude interface to function. The zip files should contain all directory contents including the `SKILL.md` file, scripts, and assets.\n",
