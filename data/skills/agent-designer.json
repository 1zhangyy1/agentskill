Don't add `.codex_uploads/` to `.gitignore`, or Gemini may refuse to read ignored paths.\n\nKey files\n  - AGENTS.md (project rules)\n  - .codex/skills/ (all skills)\n  - docs/SKILLs/agent-skills-standard.md (skill design standard)\n  - docs/mcp-tools.md (MCP tools catalog)\n  - docs/testing-policy.md (testing defaults)\n  - issues/README.md (Issue CSV format)\n\nCommon actions\n  - Regenerate MCP tools catalog: use the mcp-tools-catalog skill\n  - Draft a new AGENTS.md: use the agents-bootstrap skill\n  - Collaborate with Claude: use the collaborating-with-claude skill (bridge script; don't run `claude` directly)\n  - Collaborate with Gemini: use the collaborating-with-gemini skill (bridge script; don't run `gemini` directly)\n  - Validate skill structure: follow docs/SKILLs/agent-skills-standard.md\n\nNotes\n  - This repo is documentation- and workflow-first. Most changes are text.\n  - Use official docs as the primary source of truth.\n  - If invoking bridge scripts directly, prefer `python3` (some systems don't have `python`).\n  - Skill authoring best-practice: reference `docs/SKILLs/agent-skills-standard.md` in chat (e.g., \"@docs/SKILLs/agent-skills-standard.md\") and iterate.\n\nAcknowledgements\n  - Initial inspiration:\n    - https://github.com/anthropics/skills\n    - https://github.com/GuDaStudio/skills\n",
