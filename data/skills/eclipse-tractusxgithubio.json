  "readme": "# Eclipse Tractus-X website\n\nThis website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.\n\n## How to deploy\n\nThis deploys through GitHub actions!\n\n## How to use locally\n\nTo use this site locally and see your doc rendered as website, just use the following commands.\n\n- `npm install` (only initially needed)\n- `npm start`\n\nThis will install all dependencies necessary and run the website on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).\n\n## Linting\n\nWe do want to follow a specific style for our markdown based documentation.\nTherefore, this repository is configured to use a [markdown linter](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2).\nSpecific rules are configured via [.markdownlint.yaml](./.markdownlint.yaml).\n\nAdditionally, there is a npm script `lint-doc`, that will lint all the markdown files inside [docs](./docs) and `lint-kits`, that will lint all the markdown files inside [docs-kits](./docs-kits).\nThis script is also run as a pre-commit hook, set up via [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).\nYou can also run the linting step manually by running `npm run lint-doc` or `npm run lint-kits`.\n\n## 3rd Party dependency checks\n\nThis repository enforces license compatibility checks on all Pull Requests. This is demanded by [TRG 7.04](/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-04#checking-libraries-using-the-eclipse-dash-license-tool).\nFollow these steps if your PR's workflow fails on the action `3rd Party dependency check (Eclipse Dash)`:\n\n1. Make sure the error-message is not `[main] ERROR Error response from XYZ HTTP 524` or anything else pointing to\n  failures in remote services. If that happens, try again tomorrow. If not, continue.\n2. Have java installed. Check by executing `java --version` in your bash terminal. For Windows Powershell or command\n  prompt, this and the following commands may look different but should follow the same structure.\n3. Download the jar of the dash license tool's latest release (for instance [distributed via eclipse](https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/dash-licenses/org/eclipse/dash/org.eclipse.dash.licenses/)).\n4. Move the file into the top level folder of this repository. Do not add it to git or commit it.\n5. Navigate your terminal to the top level folder of this project (eclipse-tractusx.github.io).\n6. Execute `java -jar ./org.eclipse.dash.licenses-1.1.0.jar package-lock.json -project automotive.tractusx -summary ./DEPENDENCIES`\n  Adjust the version of the jar if necessary. You should see logs saying `[main] INFO Querying X for license data for Y items.`\n  and`[main] INFO Found Z items.`\n7. Commit the changed `DEPENDENCIES` file and push to your branch again.\n",
