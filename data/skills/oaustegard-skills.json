  "readme": "# claude-skills\nMy collection of Claude skills -- primarily used for the Claude.ai PaaS skill compute environment, mileage will vary if attempted used as Claude Code Agent Skills \n\n## Installing Skills\n\n### For Claude.ai (Web/Mobile)\n\n1. To install a skill in Claude.ai you first need a paid account (Claude Pro or Team)\n2. Download the skill ZIP from the [Releases page](../../releases)\n   - **Note:** Each release includes a direct download link for the skill ZIP - use that, not the \"Source code\" archives auto-generated by GitHub\n3. Upload to [Claude.ai Skills Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)\n4. See [official documentation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills) for more details\n\n### For Claude Code (Automated Installation)\n\nInstall skills directly to your project with a single command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.sh | bash\n```\n\nOr download and customize which skills to install:\n\n```bash\n# Download the script\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.sh\n\n# Edit SKILLS array to select which skills to install\nnano install-skills.sh\n\n# Run installation\nchmod +x install-skills.sh\n./install-skills.sh\n```\n\n**Features:**\n- ✅ Installs skills to `.claude/skills/` directory\n- ✅ Always pulls latest versions from main branch\n- ✅ Automatic cleanup of workflow metadata\n- ✅ Customizable skill selection\n\n**CI/CD Integration:**\n\nSet up automated skill updates with GitHub Actions:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p .github/workflows\ncurl -o .github/workflows/install-skills.yml \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oaustegard/claude-skills/main/templates/installation/install-skills.yml\n```\n\nThen trigger via: **Actions** → **Install Claude Skills** → **Run workflow**\n\nFor complete documentation, see [templates/installation/README.md](templates/installation/README.md)\n\n## Contributing Skills\n\n(Not actually sure about the workflow for a forked repo back to mine -- someone will have to test and report, but within your _own_ fork:...)\n\n### Via ZIP Upload (Easiest)\n\n1. Create your skill folder with `SKILL.md` at the root\n2. Package your skill:\n   ```bash\n   # Correct structure:\n   your-skill.zip\n     └── your-skill/\n         ├── SKILL.md\n         └── resources/  (optional)\n\n   # NOTE: Do NOT include a VERSION file in your ZIP\n   # VERSION files are workflow metadata and will be ignored\n   ```\n3. Upload the ZIP to the `uploads/` directory\n4. The workflow will automatically create a PR with your skill content\n5. When ready to release, update the VERSION file separately (see \"Releasing Skills\" below)\n\n### Via Direct Development\n\n1. Create a new branch\n2. Add your skill folder at the repository root (SKILL.md and resources)\n3. Submit a PR with your skill content\n4. When ready to release, update the VERSION file separately (see \"Releasing Skills\" below)\n\n## Releasing Skills\n\n**Important:** VERSION files are workflow metadata, separate from skill content.\n\n- Releases are triggered **explicitly** by updating VERSION files on main branch\n- Simply changing skill content does NOT trigger a release\n- This separation allows you to iterate on skills without creating releases for every change\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Develop & Update:** Upload ZIPs or edit skill files directly → PRs update skill content in repo\n2. **Release When Ready:** Update VERSION file → Automatic release created with downloadable ZIP\n\n### Creating a New Release\n\n1. Update the `VERSION` file in your skill folder:\n   ```bash\n   echo \"1.1.0\" > your-skill/VERSION\n   ```\n\n2. Commit and push (or merge PR):\n   ```bash\n   git add your-skill/VERSION\n   git commit -m \"chore: bump your-skill to v1.1.0\"\n   git push\n   ```\n\n3. The workflow will automatically:\n   - Create a properly structured ZIP file (VERSION excluded - it's not part of the skill)\n   - Generate a GitHub release with tag `your-skill-v1.1.0`\n   - Attach the ZIP as a release asset\n   - Generate release notes from recent commits\n   - Users download this ZIP to install the skill\n\n### Manual Release\n\nYou can also trigger a release manually via GitHub Actions:\n\n1. Go to Actions → Release Skill → Run workflow\n2. Enter the skill folder name\n3. Optionally specify a version (otherwise uses VERSION file)\n\n### Version Format\n\nUse [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):\n- `1.0.0` - Initial release\n- `1.0.1` - Patch (bug fixes)\n- `1.1.0` - Minor (new features, backward compatible)\n- `2.0.0` - Major (breaking changes)\n\n## Resources\n\n- https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills\n- https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills\n",
