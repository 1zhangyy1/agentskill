  "readme": "# Claude Skills Collection\n\nPersonal collection of custom Claude skills, created as I discover patterns and solve real-world problems.\n\n## Skills\n\n### Knowledge Management & Education\n\n#### obsidian-study-vault-builder\nBuild comprehensive, mobile-compatible Obsidian study vaults from academic course materials with checkpoint-based workflow, error pattern recognition, and quality assurance. Works across all subjects - CS, medicine, business, self-study.\n\n**Battle-tested:** 37-file vaults, 828KB content, 910-line comprehensive patterns, ~80 hours saved per project.\n\n[See obsidian-study-vault-builder/README.md](obsidian-study-vault-builder/README.md)\n\n### Document Processing\n\n#### document-quality-standards\nQuality patterns for all document operations (DOCX, PDF, XLSX, PPTX). Visual verification workflow, typography hygiene, formula best practices. Patterns from OpenAI skills that Anthropic's document-skills plugin lacks.\n\n[See document-quality-standards/](document-quality-standards/)\n\n#### docx-template-filling\nFill DOCX template forms programmatically while preserving 100% of original structure - logos, footers, styles, metadata. Zero-artifact insertion for forms, applications, and standardized documents. Output indistinguishable from manual filling.\n\n**Key features:** Anchor-based XML insertion, structure preservation, table repositioning, executable inspection script.\n\n[See docx-template-filling/](docx-template-filling/)\n\n#### docx-advanced-patterns\nAdvanced python-docx patterns for nested tables, complex cell structures, and content extraction beyond basic `.text` property. Complements official docx skill with specialized read techniques.\n\n[See docx-advanced-patterns/README.md](docx-advanced-patterns/README.md)\n\n#### rtl-document-translation\nTranslate structured documents (DOCX) to RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu) while preserving exact formatting, table structures, colors, and layouts.\n\n[See rtl-document-translation/README.md](rtl-document-translation/README.md)\n\n---\n\n*More skills will be added as I discover and document new patterns.*\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Install (All Skills)\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repository\ngit clone https://github.com/belumume/claude-skills.git\n\n# Copy all skills to Claude\ncp -r claude-skills/*/ ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n### Individual Skill\n\n```bash\n# Install specific skill\ncp -r claude-skills/obsidian-study-vault-builder ~/.claude/skills/\n```\n\n### In Claude Web/Desktop\n\nReady-to-upload ZIPs are in `web-desktop-exports/`:\n\n```\nweb-desktop-exports/\n├── document-quality-standards.zip\n├── docx-advanced-patterns.zip\n├── docx-template-filling.zip\n├── obsidian-study-vault-builder.zip\n└── rtl-document-translation.zip\n```\n\n1. Download the ZIP for the skill you want\n2. Go to Settings → Capabilities\n3.
