  "readme": "# Weaviate Skills Collection\n\nA comprehensive set of Claude Skills for working with **local Weaviate vector databases**. These skills enable you to connect, manage, ingest data, and query Weaviate running in Docker directly through Claude.ai or Claude Desktop.\n\n## Important: Local Weaviate Required\n\n**These skills are designed for LOCAL Weaviate instances running in Docker.**\n\n⚠️ **Claude Desktop and Claude Web have network restrictions** that prevent connections to external services like Weaviate Cloud. Therefore, these skills use a local Docker-based Weaviate instance that runs on `localhost:8080` with no network limitations.\n\n**Benefits of Local Setup:**\n- ✅ No network restrictions in Claude\n- ✅ Free (no cloud costs)\n- ✅ Fast local queries\n- ✅ Full data privacy and control\n- ✅ Works offline (with transformers vectorizer)\n\n## What are Claude Skills?\n\nClaude Skills are self-contained knowledge modules that Claude can load on-demand. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, code examples, and best practices for a specific task.\n\nSkills provide:\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Claude only loads what it needs\n- **Composability**: Skills can depend on other skills\n- **Portability**: Easy to share and reuse across projects\n- **No Deployment**: Works directly in Claude.ai web or Claude Desktop\n- **Client-Friendly**: Just download folders and start using\n- **Local-First**: Run Weaviate in Docker, no external dependencies\n\n## Available Skills\n\n### 0. [weaviate-local-setup](weaviate-local-setup/) **← START HERE**\nSet up and manage a local Weaviate instance using Docker for development and testing.\n\n**When to use**: Before anything else - sets up your local Weaviate database\n\n**Key features**:\n- Docker and Docker Compose configurations\n- Multiple vectorizer options (transformers, OpenAI, Cohere)\n- Data persistence and backup\n- No cloud costs or network restrictions\n- Perfect for Claude Desktop/Web environments\n\n### 1. [weaviate-connection](weaviate-connection/)\nConnect to your local Weaviate instance and verify connection health.\n\n**When to use**: After starting Weaviate - establishes database connection\n\n**Key features**:\n- Local connection to Docker instance\n- Environment variable management\n- Connection health checks\n- Error troubleshooting\n\n### 2. [weaviate-collection-manager](weaviate-collection-manager/)\nCreate, view, update, and delete Weaviate collections with comprehensive schema management.\n\n**When to use**: Setting up database schema, managing collections\n\n**Key features**:\n- List and inspect collections\n- Create collections with various vectorizers\n- Configure RAG and reranking\n- Data type reference tables\n- Multi-modal collection support\n\n### 3. [weaviate-data-ingestion](weaviate-data-ingestion/)\nUpload data to Weaviate collections with support for single objects, batch uploads, and multi-modal content.\n\n**When to use**: Adding documents, images, or any data to collections\n\n**Key features**:\n- Single and batch object insertion\n- JSON/CSV file import\n- Image upload (base64 encoding)\n- Document chunking strategies\n- Progress tracking for large uploads\n- Error handling and validation\n\n### 4. [weaviate-query-agent](weaviate-query-agent/)\nSearch and retrieve data using semantic search, filters, RAG, and hybrid queries.\n\n**When to use**: Searching collections, Q&A, finding similar items\n\n**Key features**:\n- Semantic vector search\n- Keyword (BM25) search\n- Hybrid search\n- Advanced filtering\n- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n- Multi-modal image search\n- Aggregation and analytics\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1: Get the Skills\n\n**Option A: Download**\n1. Download this repository as ZIP\n2. Extract the `weaviate-skills` folder\n3. Place it somewhere accessible (e.g., `~/Documents/`)\n\n**Option B: Clone**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/saskinosie/weaviate-claude-skills.git ~/Documents/weaviate-claude-skills\n```\n\n**Option C: Project Integration**\n1. Add `weaviate-skills/` to your project repository\n2. Commit skills alongside your code\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment (Optional)\n\n**Claude will handle this automatically**, but you can set it up manually if preferred:\n\n```bash\ncd weaviate-claude-skills\n\n# Create virtual environment\npython3 -m venv .venv\n\n# Activate it\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n# OR\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Note:** When you use the skills with Claude, Claude will check for dependencies and create the virtual environment if needed.\n\n### Step 3: Start Local Weaviate\n\n**Required: Docker Desktop must be installed and running**\n\n```bash\ncd weaviate-claude-skills/weaviate-local-setup\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\nWait 10-15 seconds for startup, then verify:\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready\n```\n\n### Step 4: Use in Claude\n\n**Claude.ai Web:**\n1. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)\n2. Upload the individual `SKILL.md` files you need (attachment limit: 20 files)\n3. Upload your `.env` file\n4. Say: \"Connect to my local Weaviate instance\"\n\n**Claude Desktop:**\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. Reference the skills folder in your conversation\n3. Say: \"I have Weaviate skills in ~/Documents/weaviate-skills. Connect to my local Weaviate instance.\"\n\n**Note**: Due to the 20-file attachment limit in Claude Web, you may need to upload skills individually rather than the entire folder (the `.git` folder contains many files). Claude Desktop doesn't have this limitation.\n\n## Installation Details\n\n### Python Environment\n\n**Claude handles dependency management automatically!** When you first use the skills, Claude will:\n1. Check if a virtual environment exists\n2. Create `.venv/` if needed\n3. Install required packages (weaviate-client, python-dotenv, etc.)\n4. Run all Python code within the virtual environment\n\n**Manual setup (optional):**\n```bash\ncd weaviate-claude-skills\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThe `requirements.txt` includes:\n```\nweaviate-client>=4.0.0\nopenai>=1.0.0\npython-dotenv>=1.0.0\n```\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nYour configuration goes in a `.env` file in the project root:\n\n1. **Copy the template**:\n   ```bash\n   cp .env.example .env\n   ```\n\n2. **Edit `.env` with your credentials**:\n   ```bash\n   # Weaviate Connection (REQUIRED)\n   WEAVIATE_URL=your-cluster.weaviate.cloud  # NO https:// prefix\n   WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your-weaviate-api-key\n\n   # Vectorizer API Keys (optional, only if using these services)\n   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key\n   COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key\n   ```\n\n3. **Where to find your Weaviate credentials**:\n   - Log into [Weaviate Cloud Console](https://console.weaviate.cloud/)\n   - Click on your cluster\n   - **REST Endpoint**: Copy the URL (without `https://`)\n   - **API Key**: Click \"API Keys\" to view/generate\n\n**Important**:\n- `.env` is in `.gitignore` - never commit secrets to version control!\n- Share `.env.example` with your clients as a template\n- Each person needs their own `.env` file with their credentials\n\n### Local Setup (Docker)\n\nFor local development or if you have network restrictions in Claude:\n\n1. **Install Docker Desktop** (if not already installed)\n\n2. **Start Weaviate locally** using the `weaviate-local-setup` skill:\n   ```bash\n   cd weaviate-skills/weaviate-local-setup\n   docker-compose up -d\n   ```\n\n3. **Update your `.env` for local connection**:\n   ```bash\n   WEAVIATE_URL=localhost:8080\n   WEAVIATE_API_KEY=  # Leave empty for local\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify it's running**:\n   ```bash\n   curl http://localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready\n   ```\n\n**Benefits of local setup**:\n- No network restrictions (works in Claude Web and Claude Desktop)\n- Free (no cloud costs)\n- Faster development cycles\n- Full data control and privacy\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Cloud Workflow\n```\n1.

Query and Search (weaviate-query-agent)\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Example 1: Complete Setup\n\n```\nYou: \"I want to create a vector database for my technical documentation\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-connection skill*\n        \"Let me help you connect to Weaviate. Do you have a Weaviate Cloud\n        account or a local instance?\"\n\nYou: \"I have a cloud instance at xyz.weaviate.cloud\"\n\nClaude: *Guides through connection setup*\n        *Tests connection*\n        ✅ Connected to Weaviate successfully!\n\nYou: \"Create a collection for technical documents with RAG enabled\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-collection-manager skill*\n        *Creates optimized collection schema*\n        ✅ Created 'TechnicalDocuments' collection with OpenAI vectorizer and GPT-4 RAG\n\nYou: \"Upload these 100 PDF files from /docs folder\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-data-ingestion skill*\n        *Processes PDFs, chunks text, batch uploads*\n        📊 Processing: [████████████████████] 100/100\n        ✅ Successfully uploaded 100 documents (523 chunks)\n\nYou: \"Find information about seismic zone requirements\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-query-agent skill*\n        *Performs semantic search with RAG*\n\n        🤖 Answer: Seismic zone requirements vary by location...\n        📚 Sources: Building Code Manual (Page 45), Seismic Guidelines (Page 12)\n```\n\n### Example 2: Quick Search\n\n```\nYou: \"Search my product catalog for items similar to 'wireless headphones under $200'\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-connection and weaviate-query-agent*\n        *Connects to existing collection*\n        *Runs hybrid search with price filter*\n\n        Found 8 products:\n        • Sony WH-1000XM4 - $179.99\n        • Bose QuietComfort 45 - $199.00\n        • ...\n```\n\n### Example 3: Data Import\n\n```\nYou: \"Import products.json into my ProductCatalog collection\"\n\nClaude: *Loads weaviate-data-ingestion skill*\n        *Validates JSON structure*\n        *Batch uploads with progress tracking*\n\n        📄 Loaded 500 products from products.json\n        ✅ Successfully uploaded: 500\n        ⏱️  Time: 12.3 seconds\n```\n\n## Skill Dependencies\n\nEach skill declares its dependencies in the frontmatter:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  - weaviate-connection\n  - weaviate-collection-manager\n```\n\nClaude will automatically load prerequisite skills as needed.\n\n## Sharing with Friends\n\n### For Testing/Demos\n\n1. Share the `weaviate-skills` folder via:\n   - Email (ZIP file)\n   - Dropbox/Google Drive link\n   - GitHub repository\n\n2. Provide your client with:\n   - The skills folder\n   - Their Weaviate credentials (`.env` template)\n   - Simple instructions: \"Open Claude.ai and tell it you have Weaviate skills to load\"\n\n### For Production Use\n\n1. Create a dedicated Weaviate cluster for the client\n2. Provide read-only or scoped API keys\n3. Share the skills folder\n4. Client can use Claude.ai web (no technical setup required)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with Connection**: Always load `weaviate-connection` first\n2. **Check Schema**: Review collection schema before ingesting data\n3. **Batch Upload**: Use batch operations for multiple objects\n4. **Use Filters**: Combine vector search with filters for precision\n5. **Monitor Quotas**: Track API usage for OpenAI/Cohere vectorizers\n6. **Version Control**: Keep skills in your repository for team collaboration\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Cannot connect to Weaviate\" or \"Network domain not allowed\"\n\n**For Cloud Instances:**\n- Verify URL doesn't include `https://` prefix\n- Check API key is correct\n- Ensure cluster is running (for self-hosted)\n\n**For Claude Desktop/Web with Network Restrictions:**\n- Use the local setup instead (see `weaviate-local-setup` skill)\n- In Claude Desktop: Add `*.weaviate.cloud` to **Settings → Capabilities → Allow network egress → Additional allowed domains**\n- Or run Weaviate locally with Docker (no network restrictions)\n\n### \"No results found\"\n- Confirm collection has data\n- Try broader search terms\n- Check vectorizer is configured correctly\n\n### \"Batch upload fails\"\n- Reduce batch size\n- Validate data types match schema\n- Check for network timeouts\n\n### Local Docker Issues\n- Port 8080 already in use: Change port or stop conflicting service\n- Container won't start: Check logs with `docker logs weaviate`\n- Data not persisting: Ensure you're using volumes (`-v weaviate-data:/var/lib/weaviate`)\n\nSee individual skill files for detailed troubleshooting guides.\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n### Custom RAG Pipelines\nCombine `weaviate-query-agent` with custom LLM calls for specialized Q&A systems.\n\n### Multi-Modal Search\nUse `weaviate-collection-manager` to create CLIP-enabled collections for image+text search.\n\n### Automated Workflows\nChain skills together for complete data processing pipelines.\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Minimum**:\n- Python 3.8+\n- weaviate-client library\n- Weaviate instance (cloud or local)\n\n**Optional** (depending on vectorizer):\n- OpenAI API key (for text2vec-openai)\n- Cohere API key (for text2vec-cohere)\n- HuggingFace models (for text2vec-huggingface)\n\n**For Local Development**:\n- Docker Desktop (for weaviate-local-setup)\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nweaviate-skills/\n├── README.md                          # This file\n├── .env.example                       # Environment template\n├── .gitignore                         # Git ignore rules\n├── weaviate-connection/\n│   └── SKILL.md                       # Connection skill\n├── weaviate-collection-manager/\n│   └── SKILL.md                       # Collection management skill\n├── weaviate-data-ingestion/\n│   └── SKILL.md                       # Data upload skill\n├── weaviate-query-agent/\n│   └── SKILL.md                       # Query and search skill\n└── weaviate-local-setup/\n    ├── SKILL.md                       # Local Weaviate setup guide\n    └── docker-compose.yml             # Docker Compose configuration\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!
