The instructions below are Ubuntu based:\n\n1. Make sure you have all the repos propoerly cloned:\n````sh\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n````\n\n2. Install dependences:\n\n````sh\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y $(\n  awk '/apt-get install/,/apt-get clean/' Dockerfile \\\n  | sed '1d;$d; s/[\\\\[:space:]]*$//; s/^[[:space:]]*//' \\\n  | grep -v '^$' \\\n  | tr '\\n' ' '\n)\n````\n\n4. Have this repo built from source:\n````sh\nsource setup.sh  # Set up environment variables\nmake build-all   # Build all components\n````\n\nIf you do not have enough memory, a lower job number is recommended.\n\n5. Verify your installation.\n````sh\npython -c 'import assassyn' # import this module\necho $? # 0 is expected\nmake test-all # Optional, runs all the tests.\necho $?\n````\n\n## File Structure\n\nOur file structure is as follows:\n\n```\n- assassyn/                 # The main assassyn package\n  |- python/                # All the Python-related code\n  |  |- assassyn/           # The assassyn Python package\n  |  `- ci-tests/           # Application-level tests for CI\n  |- 3rd-party/             # External depdendencies\n  |  |- circt/              # It relies on CIRCT for Verilog backend\n  |  |- ramulator2          # It relies on Ramulator2 for DRAM modeling\n  |  `- verilator           # It relies on Verilator for Verilog simulation\n  |- scripts/\n  |  |- *.patch             # Useful scripts for patching 3rd-party\n  |  |- pre-commit          # Git pre-commit hook\n  |  `- init/*.inc          # Makefile includes for building components\n  |- docs/                  # The chater document of this framework\n  |  |- developer/          # Developer guidelines\n  |  |- design/             # High-level design decisions of Assassyn\n  |  `- builder/            # Document to build and setup the project\n  |- tools/                 # All the helper modules\n  |  |- c-ramulator-wrapper # Which wraps Ramulator2 in C for FFI access\n  |  `- rust-sim-runtime    # Which provides runtime support for Rust simulator, including Ramulator access\n  |- examples/              # Example applications\n  `- tutorials/             # Tutorials written in Quarto qmd\n```\n",
