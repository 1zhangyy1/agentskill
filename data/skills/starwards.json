After extensive modifications and a productive fork, we hit fundamental limitations - EmptyEpsilon was designed for short sessions, not the lengthy LARP events we run. We decided to build Starwards from scratch as a platform designed specifically for LARP needs.\n\n# What is this?\n\nStarwards is a space and starship simulator designed specifically for LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing games). Derived from the \"Starship Bridge Simulator\" genre, Starwards is designed to support long games where the players interact with the ship's system throughout the ship, not just in the bridge.\n\n# how to run and use it\n\nCurrently executables are being built after every change. \nclick on [this link](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/starwards/starwards?branch=master&filter=build&status=none&status=success), click on the top-most \"build\" workflow, then on the \"build executables\" job, then on the \"artifacts\" tab, and choose the executable that fits your computer. \ndownload and run it, and open [this link](http://localhost/) in your browser.\n\nThis is not a solution we like. We are [open to improvements and suggestions](https://github.com/starwards/starwards/issues/832).\n\n### the game is running! now what?\nMissing documentation. contributions are welcomed!\n\nIn the \"GM\" and \"empty\" screen, the list to the left represents UI widgets that can be *dragged into the main screen*. so you build your own screen. this way each game can have their stations set up the way they want to. later we will support saving the screen presets.\n\nhttps://blog.starwards.space/2021-03-06-modular-peek/\n\n# how do I get involved\n\nStarwards is a labour of love built by enthusiastic volunteers. We eagerly welcome anyone who would like to join us, so long as they adhere to our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nPlease report any code of conduct violations to [greenshade@gmail.com](mailto:greenshade@gmail.com)\n\nTo get started, you can:\n\n1. Take a look at the \"Issues\" in this repository - especially those marked \"Good first issue\". Those with the \"Help Wanted\" tag probably don't have anyone else working on them.\n2. Drop by our [chat](https://discord.gg/p56nSVEjdb) and ask what you can work on, or how to get started.\n3. Open an issue with your idea(s) for the project or tell us about them in our chat.\n4. Read our [developers blog](https://blog.starwards.space/)\n\n## How do I contribute?\n\nPlease read [Contributing to Starwards](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n\n## License\n\n`SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`\n\nFor more details on license and copyright see [the license file](LICENSE.md)\n\nThe current license was chosen because we feel it best represents the ethics of knowledge sharing in the LARP community. If you feel that we should consider changing the license, please contact us on our [chat](https://discord.gg/p56nSVEjdb).\n",
