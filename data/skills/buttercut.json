  "readme": "# ButterCut\n\n**Make Claude your Video Editor**\n\n[buttercut.io](https://buttercut.io)\n\nGive Claude Code your video footage. Claude analyzes it, then builds roughcuts and sequences for Final Cut, Premiere, and Resolve.\n\nBehind the scenes Claude uses ButterCut Skills and a little Ruby library to generate timelines for your editor.\n\n## Watch the Demo\n\n[![I Taught Claude Code to Edit Movies](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FBkfr1yWf_s/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBkfr1yWf_s)\n\n*Click to watch \"I Taught Claude Code to Edit Movies\" on YouTube*\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[![ButterCut Install Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BCMQzg-HiTw/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCMQzg-HiTw)\n\n*Click to watch the ButterCut install video on YouTube*\n\n**Clone ButterCut:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/barefootford/buttercut.git && cd buttercut\n```\n\n**Open Claude Code:**\n```bash\nclaude\n\n# or skip permission prompts (faster, but riskier):\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tell Claude to install ButterCut:**\n```\n> Install ButterCut\n```\n\nClaude will check your system and install any missing dependencies (Ruby, Python, FFmpeg, WhisperX).\n\nFor manual installation, see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst tell Claude to create a **Library**. A library organizes your video footage along with audio and visual transcripts. Then tell Claude you want to create a **rough cut** or **sequence**.\n\n### Creating a Video Library\n\n```plaintext\nYou: \"I want to build a new library\"\n\nClaude: [Guides you through library setup and asks for details]\n\nYou:\n  - Library name: \"wedding\"\n  - Video location: \"/path/to/videos\"\n  - Language: \"English\"\n\nClaude: [Automatically processes all videos]\n  ✓ Creates library structure\n  ✓ Transcribes audio with WhisperX\n  ✓ Analyzes video frames\n  ✓ Generates visual transcripts\n\nResult: Full footage analysis ready for rough cut creation\n```\n\nClaude handles the parallel processing, metadata extraction, and transcript generation. See the [full walkthrough](docs/example-library-setup.md) for a detailed example of me setting up a library from my wedding footage.\n\n### Creating a Roughcut or Sequence\n\nOnce your library is analyzed, Claude can create rough cuts through an interactive conversation:\n\n```plaintext\nYou: \"Let's create a new roughcut\"\n\nClaude: [Loads roughcut skill and analyzes footage]\n        What should this roughcut focus on?\n        - Full story\n        - Just the meetup coverage\n        - Short teaser sequence\n\nYou: \"Just the meetup coverage\"\n\nClaude: [Asks 3 preference questions]\n        - Narrative structure? (chronological, thematic, hook-based)\n        - Target duration? (1-2 min, 3-5 min, 6-10 min)\n        - Pacing style? (fast & punchy, conversational, cinematic)\n\nYou: \"Start with presentations (5 sec clips), then interviews,\n      then my closing reflection. 3-5 minutes, conversational pacing.\"\n\nClaude: [Asks which video editor you want to use]\n        - Final Cut Pro X\n        - Adobe Premiere Pro\n        - DaVinci Resolve\n\nYou: \"Final Cut Pro X\"\n\nClaude: [Creates roughcut with editorial decisions]\n        ✓ Combined visual transcripts\n        ✓ Selected 29 clips (4:32 total)\n        ✓ Exported to FCPXML\n\nResult: Ready-to-import timeline at:\n        libraries/[library]/roughcuts/[name]_[datetime].fcpxml\n```\n\nClaude makes editorial decisions based on transcript analysis and your preferences, then exports a timeline for your editor.\n\n### XML Generation\n\nFor direct XML generation without Claude Code, see [docs/basic-xml-generation.md](docs/basic-xml-generation.md).\n\n## Thanks\n\nButterCut was inspired by ambitious open source work from [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost) and [Andrew Arrow](https://github.com/andrewarrow/cutlass/tree/main).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug reports and pull requests welcome.\n",
