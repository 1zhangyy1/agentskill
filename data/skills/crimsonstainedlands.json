  "readme": "# CrimsonStainedLands\nA MUD Server in C# Based on ROM<br />\n<br />\nIf it is running, you can connect to host Games.mywire.org or kbs-cloud.com on port 4000<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTo get started with this project locally:<br />\nClone the repository at https://github.com/malkamius/CrimsonStainedLands<br />\n<br />\nOpen the solution under CrimsonStainedLands\\master CrimsonStainedLands.sln with visual studio 2022<br />\nOr open the CrimsonStainedLands folder with VS Code after getting the C# Extension for it<br />\n<br />\nEdit the settings master\\CrimsonStainedLands\\Settings.xml if you want to change the port.<br />\n<br />\nRun the solution. It should load all the areas under the master\\CrimsonStainedLands\\data\\Areas folder. <br />\nIt will spit out a lot of logs to the screen as it loads.<br />\n<br />\nUse a mud client to connect to the localhost at the port(default 4000) specified in settings.xml<br />\n<br />\nPlayer files will be saved as XML to the master\\CrimsonStainedLands\\data\\players folder. You can log out and edit your player level using a text editor<br /><br />\n<br />\nOnce you are level 60 I recommend doing a 'help olc'. OLC is custom for this mud, so it doesn't work like other ROMs...<br />\n<br />\nI use prompt <%h/%Hhp ~%m/~%Mm %v/%Vmv %W \\Mvnum %R\\x> ; for my prompt which shows the vnum of the room I am in at 60<br />\n<br />\nIf there is any additional information I can supply, let me know. <br />\n<br />\n[Maps and EQ](https://mudmapbuilder.github.io/) by Roman Shapiro who used their tool at<br />\n[Mud Map Builder](https://github.com/MUDMapBuilder/MUDMapBuilder) to generate resources<br />\n",
