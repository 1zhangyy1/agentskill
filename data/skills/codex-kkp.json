  "readme": "# Codex KKP\n\n> KKP: **K**otlin Claude Code s**K**ill **P**lugin.\n\n## Overview\n\n[中文](README_CN.md) | **English**\n\nCodex KKP is a Claude Code Plugin that enables seamless integration with Codex AI Agent for code\nanalysis, implementation, and collaboration tasks. Provides a subagent and a skill for Codex AI Agent.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multi-platform Support**: Native binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows\n- **Streamlined results**: By default, only completed results are returned to reduce token consumption.\n- **Sandbox Modes**: Configurable security levels (read-only, workspace-write, danger-full-access)\n- **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions and maintain context\n- **Claude Code Subagents**: Run subagents in parallel to improve performance\n- **Sugar-Free, Calorie-Free**: Very healthy\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation and configuration, you can use the Codex KKP plugin within Claude Code. The plugin provides\na subagent and a skill for code analysis, implementation, and collaboration tasks.\n\nYou can verify successful installation by using `/agents` or by asking \"What skills do you have?\".\nOnce successfully installed, you can prompt Claude Code to use Codex subagents or skills through prompts, for example:\n\n```\nActively collaborate deeply with codex and subagents for task coordination and code review, ensure code quality, and perform tasks concurrently\n```\n\n```\nUse Codex to review code changes\n```\n\nClaude Code will decide on its own whether to use Skills or agents based on the prompts.\n\n### File Operations\n\ncodex-kkp requires codex to use `sandbox=read-only` mode by default. If you need codex to directly modify files,\nClaude Code must specify the correct `sandbox=workspace-write` mode or add the `--full-auto` parameter (more dangerous) when calling codex-kkp.\n\nThis is mentioned in the skills progressive documentation, but if Claude Code still cannot understand it on its own, you can include these details in your prompts.\n\nCodex will return file operation content, provided it uses tool APIs like `apply_patch` rather than some Bash/Command operations.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Download from repository\n\n**1. Download/Clone source from repository**\n\n**1.1 Download source**\n\n[Download](https://github.com/ForteScarlet/codex-kkp/archive/refs/heads/plugins/release.zip)\nthe source code for Branch `plugins/release` and extract it.\n\n**1.2 Clone source**\n\n**OR** clone the repository and\n[check out Branch `plugins/release`](https://github.com/ForteScarlet/codex-kkp/tree/plugins/release) .\n\n```\ngit clone -b plugins/release https://github.com/ForteScarlet/codex-kkp.git\n```\n\n**2. Add into Claude Code's marketplace**\n\nRun claude:\n\n```\nclaude\n```\n\nUse `/plugin`:\n\n```\n/plugin\n```\n\nChoose `Add marketplace`:\n\n```\n> Add marketplace\n```\n\nand enter the local path where you downloaded/cloned the repository.\n\n### Download from releases\n\nGo to the [releases](https://github.com/ForteScarlet/codex-kkp/releases)\nand select a version (such as the [latest](https://github.com/ForteScarlet/codex-kkp/releases/latest) version).\n\nSelect the content you need from assets, download it, and configure it:\n\n#### 1. Download marketplace zip file\n\nThe compressed file `codex-agent-collaboration-marketplace.zip` in Assets is a complete marketplace package that includes plugins and skills.\n\nAfter downloading and extracting, run Claude Code:\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\nUse the `/plugin` command:\n\n```bash\n/plugin\n```\n\nChoose `Add marketplace`:\n\n```bash\n> Add marketplace\n```\n\nThen enter the local path of your extracted marketplace directory (the directory containing the `.claude-plugin` directory).\n\n#### 2. Download skills zip file\n\nThe compressed file `codex-agent-collaboration.zip` in Assets contains a unified multi-platform skill bundle.\nYou can download and unzip it, then place the extracted directory in your skills directory\n(e.g., `<PROJECT_DIR>/.claude/skills/codex-agent-collaboration/`).\n\nThis single ZIP file includes executables for all supported platforms:\n\n- macOS x86_64 (Intel) - `executables/codex-kkp-cli-macosx64`\n- macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon) - `executables/codex-kkp-cli-macosarm64`\n- Linux x86_64 - `executables/codex-kkp-cli-linuxx64`\n- Linux ARM64 - `executables/codex-kkp-cli-linuxarm64`\n- Windows x86_64 - `executables/codex-kkp-cli-mingwx64`\n\nClaude Code will automatically select the appropriate executable for your system.\n\n#### 3. Download executable binary file\n\nStandalone binary files (e.g., `codex-kkp-cli-macosx64`, `codex-kkp-cli-mingwx64`)\nin Assets are raw executable binaries for each platform.\nYou can download only the executable file for your platform and design the skills yourself.\n\nNote: All executables use uniform naming without file extensions (including Windows (`mingwx64`) builds).\n\n## Configuration\n\nOnce you've finished installing the plugin,\nyou can proceed to configure some of your settings in advance.\n\nEdit the `.claude/settings.local.json` file in your project\nand add the following configuration to property `permissions.allow`:\n\n**Install skill only**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Skill(codex-agent-collaboration-plugin:codex-agent-collaboration)\",\n      \"Bash(~/.claude/skills/codex-agent-collaboration/executables/codex-kkp-cli-macosx64:*)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Install full plugin via marketplace**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"allow\": [\n      \"Skill(codex-agent-collaboration-plugin:codex-agent-collaboration)\",\n      \"Bash(~/.claude/marketplace/codex-kkp-skills-marketplace/codex-agent-collaboration-plugin/skills/codex-agent-collaboration/executables/codex-kkp-cli-macosx64:*)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> If loading locally, then `~/.claude/marketplace/` should be replaced with the directory of your locally downloaded\n`codex-kkp-skills-marketplace`.\n\nIn `Bash`, the path refers to the executable file within the installed plugin package\nthat corresponds to your system platform.\nYou may need to make slight adjustments based on the actual situation.\n\n## Uninstall\n\nSometimes, when you try to update or uninstall a marketplace, due to issues with the Claude Code CLI itself, the plugin\nmay not be completely uninstalled. This can lead to problems such as being unable to completely clear the plugin's\nactivation, or being unable to enable/re-enable plugins when reloading/reinstalling the marketplace. If you encounter\nthis issue, you can go to the `plugins` subdirectory in Claude Code's configuration directory, for example:\n\n```\n~/.claude/plugins\n```\n\nManually clean up the configuration files like `installed_plugins.json` and `known_marketplaces.json` to remove the\nmarketplaces and plugins you have already uninstalled, then restart a new CLI.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended to uninstall any plugins before removing marketplace.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.",
