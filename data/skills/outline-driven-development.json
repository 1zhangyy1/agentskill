  "readme": "# Outline Driven Development: The whole new paradigm for the augumented LLM Code Agent workflows.\n\n## `Vibe`s are too *shallow*, `Spec`s are too *complex*.\n### Let there be the `outline`.\n\n### And Indeed... Here it is!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n`ast-grep` | `ripgrep` | `fd` | `lsd` | `tokei` | `bat` | `jj` | MCPs\n\n### Install Various Rust-based CLI Tools with highest native optimizations through cargo\n\n#### Install Cargo (if not installed)\n\n<https://rustup.rs/>\n\n#### Linux/macOS with cargo\n\n**Install**\n\n```bash\nexport RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=native -C opt-level=3 -C codegen-units=1 -C strip=symbols\"\n\ncargo install ast-grep ripgrep fd-find lsd tokei bat git-delta just raff-cli tree-sitter-cli difftastic jj jj-cli\n```\n\n#### Windows with cargo\n\n**Install (run inside powershell)**\n```powershell\n$env:RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=native -C opt-level=3 -C codegen-units=1 -C strip=symbols -C link-arg=/LTCG -C link-arg=/OPT:REF\"\n\ncargo install ast-grep ripgrep fd-find lsd tokei bat git-delta just raff-cli tree-sitter-cli difftastic jj jj-cli\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n- **Gemini CLI:** <https://github.com/OutlineDriven/odin-gemini-cli-extension>\n  - Quick Install:\n  - ```gemini extensions install https://github.com/OutlineDriven/odin-gemini-cli-extension```\n- **Claude Code:** <https://github.com/OutlineDriven/odin-claude-plugin>\n  - Quick Install:\n    - 1. File Based (Recommended): ```git clone https://github.com/OutlineDriven/odin-claude-plugin.git && cp -r ./odin-claude-plugin/ ~/.claude/```\n    - 2. Plugin Based (Claude Marketplace): ```claude plugin marketplace add OutlineDriven/odin-claude-plugin && claude plugin install odin-claude-plugin@odin-marketplace```\n- **Codex CLI:** <https://github.com/OutlineDriven/odin-codex-plugin>\n\n- **Prompt-only (*Manual Apply for IDEs/Agents like Antigravity/Windsurf/Cursor/Augument Code ...*):** [Prompt](GENERIC_PROMPT.md)\n- **Compact Prompt-only (*Manual Apply for IDEs/Agents like Antigravity/Windsurf/Cursor/Augument Code ...*):** [Prompt](COMPACTED_PROMPT.md)\n\n### Recommended MCP Extensions\n\n#### Crucial [Automatically installed]\nast-grep | context7 | sequentialthinking-tools | actor-critic-thinking | shannon-thinking\n\n#### Additional [Manually install if needed]\nTime, Tavily, Exa, Ref-tools\n\n## Outline-Driven Development Philosophy\n\n> Deterministic scaffolds harness non-deterministic LLM creativity only when the outline stays the single source of truth and every downstream stage revalidates against it.\n\n### Deterministic-with-Non-Deterministic-LLMs-by-Nature\n\n- **Outline-as-assembly:** Human intent, compliance constraints, and architectural guardrails are compiled into a versioned outline whose hash becomes the control envelope for every agentic act.\n- **LLM-as-module:** LLM calls are intentionally non-deterministic but bounded by the outline contract; disagreement between generated code and outline immediately halts or replays the step.\n- **Telemetry feedback:** Execution traces, test verdicts, and rubric scores continuously feed back into the outline refinement loop to converge to a reproducible build.\n\n**Control Envelope Checklist**\n\n1. Canonical outline stored with content-addressable ID and time windowed approvals.\n2. Every agent invocation receives a minimized delta (outline slice) plus explicit success metrics.\n3. Determinism is measured: diff noise ≤ 2% between successive outline-conformant runs; higher variance triggers outline tightening before reattempting generation.\n\n### Design-First / Best-Practices Batteries Included\n\n- **Architecture-first:** Each outline must include interfaces, pre/postconditions, error domains, latency and memory budgets before code exists.\n- **Tooling-first:** `lsd`, `ast-grep`, `ripgrep`, `fd`, LangGraph, and MCP stacks are treated as mandatory batteries so that structural edits, search, and orchestration are reproducible.\n- **Quality gates:** Spec → outline → implementation is instrumented with lint/test/benchmark gates plus rollback hooks.\n- **Observability:** Outline nodes ship tracing IDs and contract assertions so failures are attributable to outline leaves rather than opaque LLM conversations.\n\n### Traceability Matrix\n\n| Diagram | Goal | Associated Invariants |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Architecture | Map outline-to-toolchain interfaces | Outline hash monotonicity |\n| Data-flow | Guarantee data never bypasses verification | Contract-bound IO only |\n| Concurrency | Preserve happens-before relationships | No circular waits; deadlock-free |\n| Memory | Ensure ownership + persistence model | Leak-free caches, append-only audit |\n| Optimization | Tie budgets to feedback loops | Regression triggers deterministic rollback |\n",
