The defaults are intentionally minimal, containing only configuration templates for three primary systems: Claude Code, Serena, and Task Master. Users can opt-in to additional claude-code features like [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), [plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins), [hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide), [sub-agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents), and so on.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This configuration also focuses on collaborative development workflows where multiple developers are working on the same code-base, which is one of the reasons why most of claude- and mcp-related settings are local-scoped (i.e. most claude settings will be in `.claude/settings.local.json` so they can be shared with the entire dev team, and not in user-scoped `~/claude/settings.json`, which are harder to share with others.)\n>\n> For this same reason, most of the claude/mcp configuration files are not git-ignored, but instead committed to the repo.\n\n## Features\n\n- **🤖 Four Pre-Configured MCP Servers**\n  - **Context7**: Up-to-date library documentation and code examples\n  - **Serena**: Semantic code analysis with LSP integration for intelligent navigation\n  - **Task Master**: AI-powered task management and workflow orchestration\n  - **Pal**: Multi-model AI integration for debugging, code review, and planning\n\n- **⚙️ Automated Template Cleanup**\n  - GitHub Actions workflow for one-click repository initialization\n  - Configurable inputs for language detection and Task Master settings\n  - Automatic cleanup of template-specific files for a clean starting point\n\n- **📋 50+ Task Master Slash Commands**\n  - Pre-configured hierarchical command structure under `/project:tm/`\n  - Commands for task management, complexity analysis, PRD parsing, and workflows\n  - Complete command reference in `.claude/TM_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md`\n\n- **🔍 Intelligent Code Navigation**\n  - Serena's symbol-based code analysis for efficient exploration\n  - Token-efficient reading with overview and targeted symbol queries\n  - Reference tracking and semantic understanding across your codebase\n\n- **📝 Configuration Templates**\n  - Ready-to-use templates for `.serena/`, `.taskmaster/`, and `.claude/` directories\n  - Placeholder-based customization with repository-specific values\n  - Permission configuration for tool access control\n\n- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**\n  - Project-level `CLAUDE.md` with integration guidance\n  - Task Master integration guide with 400+ lines of best practices\n  - Complete workflow specification and command references\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou will need the following on your workstation:\n\n### Tools\n\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)\n\n### API Keys\n\n- [Context7](https://context7.com/) API key\n- Gemini API key for [pal-mcp-server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server). You don't need to use gemini and can configure pal with any other provider/models. See [pal getting started docs](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) for more details.\n\n### Claude `claude.json` mcp settings\n\nYou need to have `mcpServers` present and configured in your `~/.claude.json`. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The reason we put them in the user's `claude.json` configuration, instead of repo local settings, is to prevent committing API keys, which some MCP servers might require.\n>\n> These configs are also generic enough that they can be re-used across every project, and hence is better placed in user's settings.\n\nHere's an example `mcpServers` object that you can use as a reference:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"context7\": {\n    \"type\": \"http\",\n    \"url\": \"https://mcp.context7.com/mcp\",\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_CONTEXT7_API_KEY\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"serena\": {\n    \"type\": \"stdio\",\n    \"command\": \"uvx\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"--from\",\n      \"git+https://github.com/oraios/serena\",\n      \"serena\",\n      \"start-mcp-server\",\n      \"--context\",\n      \"ide-assistant\",\n      \"--project\",\n      \".\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {}\n  },\n  \"task-master-ai\": {\n    \"type\": \"stdio\",\n    \"command\": \"npx\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"-y\",\n      \"--package=task-master-ai\",\n      \"task-master-ai\"\n    ],\n    \"headers\": {}\n  },\n  \"pal\": {\n    \"command\": \"sh\",\n    \"args\": [\n      \"-c\",\n      \"$HOME/.local/bin/uvx --from git+https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server.git pal-mcp-server\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"PATH\": \"/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:~/.local/bin\",\n      # see https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#model-configuration\n      \"DEFAULT_MODEL\": \"auto\",\n      # see https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#thinking-modes\n      \"DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE_THINKDEEP\": \"high\",\n      \"GEMINI_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY\",\n      # see https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#model-usage-restrictions\n      \"GOOGLE_ALLOWED_MODELS\": \"gemini-3-pro-preview,gemini-2.5-pro,gemini-2.5-flash\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. [Create a new project based on this template repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=claude-starter-kit&template_owner=serpro69) using the Use this template button. \n\n2. A scaffold repo will appear in your GitHub account.\n\n3. Run the `template-cleanup` workflow from your new repo, and provide some inputs for your specific use-case.\n\n**Serena MCP Configuration Inputs:**\n\n- `LANGUAGE` - the main language(s) of your project (see [Serena Programming Language Support & Semantic Analysis Capabilities](https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-language-support--semantic-analysis-capabilities) for more details on supported languages)\n\n- `SERENA_INITIAL_PROMPT` - initial prompt for the project; it will always be given to the LLM upon activating the project\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Take a look at serena [project.yaml](./.github/templates/serena/project.yml) configuration file for more details.\n\n**Task-Master MCP Configuration Inputs:**\n\n- `TM_CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - custom system prompt to override Claude Code's default behavior\n\n- `TM_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - append additional content to the system prompt\n\n- `TM_PERMISSION_MODE` - permission mode for file system operations\n\n> [!TIP]\n> See [Task Master Advanced Claude Code Settings Usage](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/blob/main/docs/examples/claude-code-usage.md#advanced-settings-usage) for more details on the above parameters.\n\n4. Clone your new repo and cd into it\n\n    Run `claude /mcp`, you should see the mcp servers configured and active:\n\n    ```\n    > /mcp\n    ╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n    │ Manage MCP servers                                                 │\n    │                                                                    │\n    │ ❯ 1. context7                  ✔ connected · Enter to view details │\n    │   2. serena                    ✔ connected · Enter to view details │\n    │   3. task-master-ai            ✔ connected · Enter to view details │\n    │   4. pal                       ✔ connected · Enter to view details │\n    ╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n    ```\n\n    Run `claude \"list your skills\"`, you should see the skills from this repo present:\n\n    ```\n    > list your skills\n\n    ● I have access to the following skills:\n\n      Available Skills\n\n      analysis-process\n      Turn the idea for a feature into a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and implementation-plan. Use in pre-implementation (idea-to-design) stages to make sure you\n      understand the requirements and have a correct implementation plan before writing actual code.\n\n      documentation-process\n      After implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, make sure to document the changes. Use after finishing the implementation phase for a feature or a bug-fix.\n\n      task-master-process\n      Workflow for task-master-ai when working with task-master tasks and PRDs. Use when creating or parsing PRDs from requirements, adding/updating/expanding tasks and other task-master-ai operations.\n\n      testing-process\n      Guidelines describing how to test the code. Use whenever writing new or updating existing code, for example after implementing a new feature or fixing a bug.\n\n      ---\n      These skills provide specialized workflows for different stages of development. You can invoke any of them by asking me to use a specific skill (e.g., \"use the analysis-process skill\" or \"help me document this feature\").\n    ```\n\n5. Update the `README.md` with a full description of your project, then run `chmod +x bootstrap.sh && ./bootstrap.sh` to finalize initialization of the repo.\n\n6. Profit\n\n## Examples\n\nSome examples of the actual claude-code workflows that were executed using templates, configs, skills, and other tools from this repository can be found in [examples](./examples) directory.\n",
