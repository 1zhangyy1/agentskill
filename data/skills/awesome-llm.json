Skills enable LLM to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all LLM platforms.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **Create a project-local or user-level skill folder**\n   Use one of these discovery paths so Claude Code finds it automatically:\n\n   * Project: `.claude/skills/webapp-testing/`\n   * User: `~/.claude/skills/webapp-testing/`\n\n2. **Add `SKILL.md`** (required)\n\n  Basic Skill Template:\n  \n  ```markdown\n  ---\n  name: my-skill-name\n  description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.\n  ---\n  \n  # My Skill Name\n  \n  Detailed description of the skill's purpose and capabilities.\n  \n  ## When to Use This Skill\n  \n  - Use case 1\n  - Use case 2\n  - Use case 3\n  \n  ## Instructions\n  \n  [Detailed instructions for LLMs on how to execute this skill]\n  \n  ## Examples\n  \n  [Real-world examples showing the skill in action]\n  ```\n\n  - Focus on specific, repeatable tasks\n  - Include clear examples and edge cases\n  - Write instructions for LLM, not end users\n  - Document prerequisites and dependencies\n  - Include error handling guidance\n\n3. **Keep supporting files small**\n   Add only what's needed (e.g., small fixtures in `resources/`, helper scripts). This keeps skills snappy to load and easier for Claude to apply.\n\n4. **Load the skill**\n\n   * **Claude (web or Desktop):** Upload a ZIP via **Settings → Capabilities → Skills** → **Upload skill**. \n   * **Claude Code (terminal):** Place the folder under `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (user). Claude Code discovers skills from these locations.\n   * **Other CLIs (Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Qwen Code):** They don't use Anthropic's Skills format natively—reference your `SKILL.md` in prompts (Gemini CLI supports `@` file/context attachments).\n  \n5. **Use it**\n   Just ask in natural language, optionally mentioning the skill by name—for example:\n   \"Use the **Webapp Testing** skill to validate the checkout flow and generate `report.md`.\" Claude can auto-invoke relevant skills based on your request. \n\n6. **(Optional) Kickstart a repo session in Claude Code**\n   Slash-commands are supported; many users run `/init` to generate a `CLAUDE.md` and bootstrap context before working.\n\n## Skills\n\n### Skills with MCP\n\n- [Notion Knowledge Capture](./notion-knowledge-capture/) -

Claude Code enhances Claude's coding capabilities with runtime access, terminal support, and code generation.\n* **Getting Started:** Launch Claude Code from VS Code or terminal. Claude Code automatically discovers skills from `.claude/skills/` (project) or `~/.claude/skills/` (user) directories.\n* **Using Skills:** Just describe what you need in natural language. Claude Code activates relevant skills automatically based on your request context.\n\n### Claude Desktop (Anthropic)\n\n**Set‑up and enable skills**\n\n* Claude Desktop provides a native application experience for Claude across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.\n* Access skills through Settings → Capabilities → Skills. Upload custom skills as ZIP files or select from available community skills.\n* Desktop app supports all Claude features including file uploads, code generation, and real-time collaboration.\n\n### Codex CLI (OpenAI)\n\n**Set‑up and enable skills**\n\n* OpenAI's Codex powers GitHub Copilot and can be accessed via CLI tools for code generation and automation.\n* While Codex doesn't natively support Anthropic's Skills format, you can adapt skills by including instructions in your prompts or configuration files.\n* Best for code completion, refactoring, and generating boilerplate code across multiple programming languages.\n\n### Gemini CLI (Google)\n\n**Set‑up and enable skills**\n\n* Install Node 20+ and then install Gemini CLI via `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` or run it on‑demand with `npx @google/gemini-cli`.\n* Run `gemini` and sign in with your Google account; a browser window will open for authentication. Gemini CLI currently doesn't have built‑in support for Anthropic skills, but you can follow skill instructions by loading your own `SKILL.md` file and referencing it in prompts. Use the `@` symbol to upload files containing your skill instructions.\n\n### OpenCode (Open-source CLI)\n\n**Set‑up and enable skills**\n\n* Install OpenCode with a one‑line script: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`.\n* Run `opencode auth login` and choose your provider (e.g., Cerebras) to configure your API key.\n* Start the interface with `opencode` and initialize your project context using `/init`.\n* OpenCode doesn't natively load Anthropic skills, but you can place a `skills/` folder in your project and ask OpenCode to read the `SKILL.md` file; this approximates skills functionality and lets you reuse instructions across tools.\n\n### Qwen Code (Alibaba)\n\n**Set‑up and enable skills**\n\n* Ensure Node 20+ is installed, then install Qwen Code with `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest` and verify with `qwen --version`. Alternatively, clone the repository and install locally.\n* Start a session by running `qwen`. Qwen Code currently doesn't support Anthropic skills directly, but you can still adopt the skill pattern by creating a `skills/` directory and prompting Qwen Code to follow the instructions in your `SKILL.md` files.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!
