the static website files\n├── skills_all/    \t\t   # everything\n├── skills_categorized/    # everything in its right place\n│   ├── backend/\n│   │   └── api-design-principles/\n│   └── web3-tools/\n│       └── solidity-security/\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### config.json example\n\nif you are using a tool that requires a config file to point to skills, it usually looks something like this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n        \"/path/to/ordinary-claude-skills/skills_all\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor map only the category or specific skill you need.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\",\n        \"/path/to/ordinary-claude-skills/skills_categorized/[category]\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## how-to examples\n\nhere is how you actually talk to claude once the skills are loaded.\n\n### scenario 1: debugging a react app\n\nload the `debugging-strategies` and `frontend-design` skills.\n\n**you:**\n> i have a react component that is not rendering the list items correctly. please use the systematic debugging skill to analyze the code i paste next, and then use the frontend design skill to propose a fix.\n\n**claude:**\n> acknowledged. i will apply the systematic debugging protocol. please paste the code.\n\n### scenario 2: analyzing a competitor\n\nload the `competitive-ads-extractor` skill.\n\n**you:**\n> here is a url to a landing page. run the ads extractor and tell me what their primary value proposition is.\n\n**claude:**\n> running extraction...\n\n### scenario 3: pdf extracting\nload the `pdf` skill.\n\n**you:**\n> a client just sent me a scanned image of a spreadsheet pasted into a word doc and then exported as a pdf. i am losing my will to live. please use the pdf skill to extract the text so i don't walk the plank.\n\n**claude:**\n> extracting text now. please drink some water while i handle this crime against data structures.\n\n### scenario 4: deploy roulette\nload the `webapp-testing` skill.\n\n**you:**\n> i am about to push to prod on a friday afternoon. run the webapp testing skill on `localhost:3000` and tell me if i am going to get fired.\n\n**claude:**\n> starting playwright tests. i suggest you keep your resume updated just in case the login modal is broken again.\n\n\n## troubleshooting\n\nsometimes computers are hard.\n\n*   **claude refuses to use the skill:**\n    make sure you explicitly told claude the skill exists in the system prompt or that the file was successfully attached to the project context. usually it just doesn't know it's there.\n\n*   **\"file too large\" error:**\n    some of these skills have massive dependency folders. ignore the `node_modules` inside skill folders. you only need the source scripts and the instructions.\n\n*   **skills contradicting each other:**\n    don't load `creative-writing` and `technical-documentation` at the same time. claude will get confused about whether it should be shakespeare or a robot.\n\n## dependencies\n\ntechnically none for the repo itself, but individual skills have requirements.\n\n*   **mandatory:** an active internet connection and a claude account (or api key).\n*   **optional:**\n    *   `python 3.x` (for data analysis skills)\n    *   `node.js` (for mcp builder and testing skills)\n    *   `playwright` (if you want to do browser automation)\n\n## license & credits\n\ni did not write most of these. i just collected them.\n\n*   **anthropic skills:** mit license (mostly)\n*   **community skills:** check the `LICENSE` file in each specific folder.\n\ncredits go to [anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics), [composiohq](https://github.com/ComposioHQ), [k-dense-ai](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI), and the other legends listed in the source tables. if you own one of these and want me to take it down, just open an issue and i will nuke it.\n",
