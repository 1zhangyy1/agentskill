The\ninternal name to the monorepo is `depot`, which is a friendly homage to [tvl].\n\nDo not touch. Feel free to ask questions, though.\n\n[x]: https://github.com/xe/x\n[tvl]: https://tvl.fyi/\n\n# License\n\nLook at the code specifically, but generally everything here is Apache 2.0 (see\n`LICENSE.txt` for details).\n",
