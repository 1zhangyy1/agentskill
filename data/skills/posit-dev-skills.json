Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/posit-dev/skills.git\n   cd skills\n   ```\n\n2. Copy individual skills to your Claude Code skills directory:\n   ```bash\n   cp -r open-source/release-post ~/.config/claude-code/skills/\n   ```\n\n3. Or install all skills from a category:\n   ```bash\n   for skill in open-source/*/; do\n     cp -r \"$skill\" ~/.config/claude-code/skills/\n   done\n   ```\n\n### Claude.ai\n\nSkills can be uploaded to Claude.ai following the [Creating Custom Skills guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-creating-custom-skills).\n\n### Claude API\n\nUse the [Skills API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) to programmatically load and manage skills in your applications.\n\n## Using Skills\n\nOnce installed, Claude will automatically activate relevant skills based on your task. You don't need to explicitly invoke them.\n\nFor example, with the `release-post` skill installed:\n\n```\nYou: Help me write a release post for dplyr 1.2.0\n\nClaude: I'll help you create a release post. First, let me gather some information...\n```\n\nClaude will use the skill's knowledge to guide you through creating a properly formatted release post.\n\n## Skill Categories\n\nThis repository organizes skills into categories to make it easier to find and install skills relevant to your work:\n\n| Category | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **open-source** | General open-source package development and maintenance |\n| **r-lib** | R package development with the r-lib ecosystem |\n| **shiny** | Shiny app development and deployment (R and Python) |\n| **quarto** | Quarto document creation and publishing |\n\n<!-- Future category ideas\n\n| **tidyverse** | Tidyverse-specific package development |\n| **connect** | Posit Connect deployment and management |\n-->\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!
