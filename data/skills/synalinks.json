Help us reach more AI/ML engineers and grow the community. ⭐\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\nThis repository contains skills to use with Claude Code.\n\nWe'll progressively add more skills to cover more advanced Synalinks usecases, so keep tuned!\n\n## What Are Claude Skills?\n\nClaude Skills are customizable workflows that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable Claude to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across all Claude platforms.\n\n## What is the goal of Synalinks skills?\n\nThe goal of Synalinks skills is to teach Claude to use properly the Synalinks framework. Given that Synalinks is based on Keras, LMs tend to mixup Keras and other LMs framework syntax witch results in bad practices and buggy code. These skills are provided to streamline the development of neuro-symbolic applications with Synalinks framework.\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/SynaLinks/synalinks-skills.git\ncd synalinks-skills\n```\n\n## Using Skills in Claude\n\nClick the skill icon (🧩) in your chat interface.\nAdd skills from the marketplace or upload custom skills.\nClaude automatically activates relevant skills based on your task.\n\nTo use these skills with Claude API and Claude.ai you'll need to zip the skills with:\n\n```shell\nzip -r synalinks.skill synalinks/\n```\n\nSee [Using skills with Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude#h_c6008b84ad) for more information.\n\n### Using Skills in Claude Code\n\nPlace the skill in `~/.config/claude-code/skills/`:\n\n```shell\nmkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code/skills/\ncp -r synalinks ~/.config/claude-code/skills/\n```\n\nVerify skill metadata:\n\n```shell\nhead ~/.config/claude-code/skills/synalinks/SKILL.md\n```\n\nStart Claude Code:\n\n```shell\nclaude\n```\n\nThe skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.\n\n# License\n\nThese skills are licensed under Apache 2.0, like Synalinks framework.\n\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for full details.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.\n\n## Acknoledgement\n\nThese skills have been created by [Ramiro Salas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsalas/) the CTO of [Hexatropian](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hextropian-systems/) an active early member of [Synalinks](https://github.com/SynaLinks/synalinks) community.\n\n## Synalinks Project\n\n- [Synalinks Framework](https://github.com/SynaLinks/synalinks) - The neuro-symbolic AI framework these skills are designed for\n",
