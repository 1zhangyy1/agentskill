  "readme": "# Hugging Face Skills\n\nHugging Face Skills are Agent Context Protocol (ACP) definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor.\n\n## How do Skills work?\n\nIn practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an `AGENTS.md` file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a `gemini-extension.json` file. **This repo is compatible with all of them, and more!**\n\n## Installation\n\nHugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI. With integrations Cursor, Windsurf, and Continue, on the way.\n\n### Claude Code\n\n1. Register the repository as a plugin marketplace:  \n   \n```\n/plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills\n```\n\n2. To install a skill, run:  \n   \n```\n/plugin install <skill-folder>@huggingface-skills\n```\n\nFor example:  \n\n```\n/plugin install model-trainer@huggingface-skills\n```\n\n### Codex\n\n1. Codex will identify the skills via the `AGENTS.md` file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with:\n\n```\ncodex --ask-for-approval never \"Summarize the current instructions.\"\n```\n\n2. For more details, see the [Codex AGENTS guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).\n\n### Gemini CLI\n\n1. This repo includes `gemini-extension.json` to integrate with the Gemini CLI.\n\n2. Install locally:  \n\n```\ngemini extensions install . --consent\n```\n\nor use the GitHub URL:\n\n```\ngemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent\n```\n\n4. See [Gemini CLI extensions docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/#installing-an-extension) for more help.\n\n## Skills\n\nThis repository contains a few skills to get you started. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository.\n\n### Available skills\n\n| Skill Folder            | Description                                                                                                                | Documentation                                          |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `hf_dataset_creator/`   | Prompts, templates, and scripts for creating structured training datasets. | [SKILL.md](hf_dataset_creator/skills/hugging-face-dataset-creator/SKILL.md) |\n| `hf_model_evaluation/`  | Instructions plus utilities for orchestrating evaluation jobs, generating reports, and mapping metrics. | [SKILL.md](hf_model_evaluation/skills/hugging-face-evaluation-manager/SKILL.md) |\n| `hf-llm-trainer/`       | Comprehensive training skill with `SKILL.md` guidance, helper scripts (e.g., `train_sft_example.py`, `convert_to_gguf.py`, cost estimators). | [SKILL.md](hf-llm-trainer/skills/model-trainer/SKILL.md) |\n| `hf-paper-publisher/`   | Tools for publishing and managing research papers on Hugging Face Hub. Index papers from arXiv, link papers to models/datasets, generate professional research articles from templates, and manage paper authorship. | [SKILL.md](hf-paper-publisher/skills/hugging-face-paper-publisher/SKILL.md) |\n\n### Using skills in your coding agent\n\nOnce a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions:\n\n- \"Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run.\"\n- \"Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch `run_eval_job.py` on the latest checkpoint.\"\n- \"Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates.\"\n- \"Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model.\"\n\nYour coding agent automatically loads the corresponding `SKILL.md` instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task.\n\n### Contribute or customize a skill\n\n1. Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, `hf_dataset_creator/`) and rename it.\n2. Update the new folder’s `SKILL.md` frontmatter:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   name: my-skill-name\n   description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it\n   ---\n\n   # Skill Title\n   Guidance + examples + guardrails\n   ```\n3. Add or edit supporting scripts, templates, and documents referenced by your instructions.\n4. Reinstall or reload the skill bundle in your coding agent so the updated folder is available.\n\n### Additional references\n- Browse the latest instructions, scripts, and templates directly at [huggingface/skills](https://github.com/huggingface/skills).\n- Review Hugging Face documentation for the specific libraries or workflows you reference inside each skill.\n",
