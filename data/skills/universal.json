Skills are markdown files containing specialized knowledge that can be dynamically loaded into your agent's context only when needed.\n\n### How to Use Skills\n\nFor a real-world example on how I personally use skills see [Creating a Skill](./docs/creating-a-skill.md).\n\n### Why I built this\n\nA week ago, I reverse engineered Claude Code's skills. A day ago, I spotted this repo [openskills](https://github.com/numman-ali/openskills) which implements skills for other coding agents. Their approach works but is suboptimal. That's why I decided to build a functional equivalent to Claude Code's skills based on MCP. See [why not use openskills](./docs/FAQ.md#why-dont-i-just-use-openskills) for details.\n\n## Installation\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>\n\nAdd the skills server to Codex using the MCP add command:\n\n```bash\ncodex mcp add skills -- npx universal-skills mcp\n```\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"573\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f0fb13b-1cbd-4552-917c-1b1c36d8180c\" />\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>\n\nAdd the skills server to Claude Code using the MCP add command:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add --transport stdio skills -- npx universal-skills mcp\n```\n\n<img width=\"1298\" height=\"462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ffc36e0-0522-48fa-ab5c-871e0e206054\" />\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>OpenCode</strong></summary>\n\nAdd the skills server to your OpenCode configuration by creating or editing the `opencode.json` file in your project root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://opencode.ai/config.json\",\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"skills\": {\n      \"type\": \"local\",\n      \"command\": [\"npx\", \"universal-skills\", \"mcp\"],\n      \"enabled\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor opencode I had to be quite explicit in instructing the agent to load a skill. I will have a look into their default instructions to improve that.\n\n<img width=\"844\" height=\"446\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b61967a-122e-4289-a0b1-a078f54c55cc\" />\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Other Agents</strong></summary>\n\nThis should also work fine with Cursor and other Agent's that support MCP. Just not tested yet.\n\n</details>\n\n## Updating\n\nTo update to the latest version:\n\n```bash\n# Clear npx cache\nnpx clear-npx-cache\n\n# Or manually remove cache\nrm -rf ~/.npm/_npx-cache\n\n# Reinstall with @latest tag\ncodex mcp remove skills\ncodex mcp add skills -- npx universal-skills@latest mcp\n```\n\n## Skill Directory Structure\n\nSkills are automatically discovered from four directories in priority order (first match wins):\n\n1. `yourproject/.agent/skills/` - Project-specific skills\n2. `yourproject/.claude/skills/` - Project-specific skills\n3. `~/.agent/skills/` - Global skills\n4. `~/.claude/skills/` - Global skills\n\nEach skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:\n\n```\n.agent/skills/\n├── git/\n│   └── SKILL.md\n└── postgres/\n    └── SKILL.md\n```\n\n**Priority Resolution**: If the same skill name exists in multiple directories, the one from the higher priority directory wins. This allows you to:\n- Override global skills with project-specific versions\n- Override Claude-specific skills with universal agent skills (useful when different agents need different configurations)\n\n### Custom Skill Directories\n\nAdd additional directories to recursively search for skills using `--skill-dir` (can be specified multiple times). E.g. include skills installed via the Claude Code marketplace as follows. However, you can also install skills using `npx universal-skills install`. No benefit in using the Claude Code marketplace.\n\n```bash\ncodex mcp add skills -- npx universal-skills mcp --skill-dir ~/.claude/plugins\n```\n\n## Download and install specific skills\n\nInstall a skill from a GitHub repository:\n\n```bash\n# Interactive mode (prompts for all options)\nnpx universal-skills install\n\n# With all options\nnpx universal-skills install --repo https://github.com/user/repo --repo-dir skills/my-skill --local-dir ~/.claude/skills\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor frequently asked questions, see the [FAQ documentation](./docs/FAQ.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nYou can run `npx universal-skills mcp` in the folder of your project. It will print out which directories were searched for skills and which skills were picked up.\n\n\n",
