For more information, **check out [the website](https://nexte.st/)**.\n\nThis repository contains the source code for:\n\n- [**cargo-nextest**](cargo-nextest): a new, faster Cargo test runner\n  [![cargo-nextest on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/cargo-nextest)](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-nextest)\n  [![Documentation (website)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-nexte.st-blue)](https://nexte.st)\n- libraries used by cargo-nextest:\n  - [**nextest-runner**](nextest-runner): core logic for cargo-nextest\n    [![nextest-runner on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nextest-runner)](https://crates.io/crates/nextest-runner)\n    [![Documentation (latest release)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen)](https://docs.rs/nextest-runner)\n    [![Documentation (main)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-main-purple)](https://nexte.st/rustdoc/nextest_runner/)\n  - [**nextest-metadata**](nextest-metadata): library for calling cargo-nextest over the command line\n    [![nextest-metadata on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nextest-metadata)](https://crates.io/crates/nextest-metadata)\n    [![Documentation (latest release)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen)](https://docs.rs/nextest-metadata)\n    [![Documentation (main)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-main-purple)](https://nexte.st/rustdoc/nextest_metadata)\n  - [**nextest-filtering**](nextest-filtering): parser and evaluator for [filtersets](https://nexte.st/docs/filtersets)\n    [![nextest-filtering on crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nextest-filtering)](https://crates.io/crates/nextest-filtering)\n    [![Documentation (latest release)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen)](https://docs.rs/nextest-filtering)\n    [![Documentation (main)](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-main-purple)](https://nexte.st/rustdoc/nextest_filtering)\n\n## Minimum supported Rust version\n\nThe minimum supported Rust version to _run_ nextest with is **Rust 1.41.** Nextest is not tested against versions that are that old, but it should work with any version of Rust released in the past year. (Please report a bug if not!)\n\nThe minimum supported Rust version to _build_ nextest with is **Rust 1.89.** For building, at least the last 3 versions of stable Rust are supported at any given time.\n\nSee the [stability policy](https://nexte.st/docs/stability/) for more details.\n\nWhile a crate is pre-release status (0.x.x) it may have its MSRV bumped in a patch release. Once a\ncrate has reached 1.x, any MSRV bump will be accompanied with a new minor version.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.\n\n_Looking to contribute to nextest and don't know where to get started?_ Check out the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\n\n## License\n\n**Nextest is Free Software.** This project is available under the terms of either the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE-APACHE) or the [MIT\nlicense](LICENSE-MIT).\n\n**Like all Free Software, nextest is a gift.** Nextest is provided on an \"AS IS\" basis and there is NO WARRANTY attached to it.
