  "readme": "# LeanOS: AI-Native Operating System for Startups, Small Teams, and Founders\n\n**Status:** Active Development | **Version:** 2.2 (Goal-Oriented) | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-10\n\nAI-native OS that automates 95%+ of business operations for startups, small teams, and founders.\n\n## What It Does\n\n- **Goal-driven execution:** Declare objectives, AI decomposes into plans and executes\n- **Automates decisions:** Claude AI processes engineering, sales, marketing, and business decisions autonomously\n- **Single source of truth:** Lean Canvas (15 living documents) provides strategic context\n- **State derived from execution:** No manual tracking, metrics computed from threads\n- **Configurable autonomy:** Auto, ask, or hybrid modes per goal\n\n## Quick Navigation\n\n### Reference\n- [What is LeanOS?](docs/reference/what-is-leanos.md) - Problem, solution, core principles\n- [Architecture](docs/reference/architecture.md) - System layers and data flow\n- [All Skills](docs/reference/all-skills.md) - Complete skills reference\n\n### Workflows\n- [Canvas Setup](docs/workflows/canvas-setup.md) - Foundation-building process\n- [Sales Workflow](docs/workflows/sales-workflow.md) - Strategy → execution → learning\n- [Marketing Workflow](docs/workflows/marketing-workflow.md) - Learning-driven content\n- [Engineering Workflow](docs/workflows/engineering-workflow.md) - Verified system generation\n- [Daily Routine](docs/workflows/daily-routine.md) - Your 5-min review\n- [Causal Flow](docs/workflows/causal-flow.md) - 6-stage decision framework\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **AI-first execution:** Claude skills handle operations, not just documentation\n2. **Context-shaping over generalization:** Each skill targets specific decision types\n3. **Zero redundancy:** Information exists in ONE location only\n4. **Evidence-based decisions:** All choices trace to Canvas assumptions\n5. **Learning-driven content:** Marketing creates when business generates insights\n6. **Mode-aware operations:** Adapts to VENTURE or BOOTSTRAP business models\n7. **Human-in-the-loop:** AI executes, humans oversee strategy\n8. **Flat architecture:** Easy skill discovery and maintenance\n9. **Mathematical verification:** System designs are provably correct\n10. **Direct and production-ready:** No fluff, just actionable outputs\n11. **Continuous improvement:** Regular updates based on performance data\n12. **Transparent processes:** Clear documentation of AI decision-making\n13. **Scalable systems:** Designed for growth from day one\n14. **Ethical AI use:** Prioritizes user privacy and data security\n15. **Open collaboration:** Encourages human contributions and feedback\n16. **Modular design:** Skills and agents can be updated independently\n17. **Robust error handling:** Skills include fallback mechanisms\n18. **Comprehensive documentation:** All aspects of the OS are well-documented\n19. **Version control:** Changes tracked for accountability\n20. **User-centric design:** Focused on the needs of startups and small teams\n\n## Dual-Mode Support: Venture vs Bootstrap\n\nLeanOS supports two fundamentally different business models with mode-specific execution:\n\n### VENTURE Mode\n**For funded startups pursuing scale:**\n- **Decision Criteria:** Strategic value, market size, defensibility\n- **Metrics Focus:** MAU, ARR growth, market share, runway\n- **Research:** TAM sizing, competitive landscape, 10x opportunities\n- **Impact Formula:** `(Strategic Value × Market Size × Defensibility) / 3`\n- **Timeline:** 7-10 year exit horizon\n\n**Best for:** VC-backed companies, billion-dollar markets, winner-take-all dynamics\n\n### BOOTSTRAP Mode\n**For profitable businesses pursuing cash flow:**\n- **Decision Criteria:** Revenue impact, time to cash, profit margin\n- **Metrics Focus:** MRR, monthly profit, cash flow, LTV:CAC\n- **Research:** Current spend mapping, arbitrage opportunities, immediate revenue\n- **Impact Formula:** `(Revenue Impact × Time to Cash × Margin) / 3`\n- **Timeline:** Profitable within 3 months\n\n**Best for:** Self-funded founders, niche markets, lifestyle businesses\n\n### Mode Configuration\n\nSet your mode in `strategy/canvas/00-business-model-mode.md`:\n\n```markdown\n**Active Mode:** BOOTSTRAP\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Self-funded, need profitability within 3 months\n- Revenue-first approach to validate market\n- Exit optional, cash flow primary goal\n```\n\n**Mode impacts:**\n- Market research approach (TAM vs current spend)\n- Impact scoring in decision-making\n- Metrics tracking and dashboards\n- Success criteria for initiatives\n\nSee [Business Model Mode documentation](strategy/canvas/00-business-model-mode.md) for complete details.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```text\nlean-os/\n├── strategy/\n│   ├── goals/                # Declared objectives (PRIMARY OPERATING MODE)\n│   │   ├── active/           # Current goals with plans + state\n│   │   ├── completed/        # Achieved goals (archive)\n│   │   └── abandoned/        # Dropped goals (archive)\n│   └── canvas/               # Lean Canvas (15 files) -
