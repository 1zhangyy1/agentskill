Use the SkillTemplate for rapid development:\n\n### Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Copy the template\ncp -r SkillTemplate/skill-template my-new-skill\n\n# Customize SKILL.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md\n\n# Validate before packaging\n./SkillTemplate/scripts/validate-skill.sh my-new-skill\n\n# Package for distribution\n./SkillPackager/scripts/package-skill.sh my-new-skill\n```\n\n### Follow the Writing Skills META-SKILL\n\n**The Iron Law:** NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST\n\n1. Create pressure scenario (test without skill)\n2. Watch agent fail - document exact behavior\n3. Write minimal skill addressing those failures\n4. Verify agent now complies\n5. Close loopholes systematically\n\n**Resources:**\n- [SkillTemplate Documentation](SkillTemplate/README.md)\n- [Writing Skills META-SKILL](WritingSkills/writing-skills/SKILL.md)\n- [Integration Runbook](SkillTemplate/INTEGRATION_RUNBOOK.md)\n- [Claude Code Skills Documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! To add a new skill:\n\n1. Fork this repository\n2. Use SkillTemplate as starting point\n3. Follow Writing Skills META-SKILL methodology (test first!)\n4.
