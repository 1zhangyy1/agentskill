  "readme": "# The Unofficial Swift Programming Language Skill\n\n[![Agent Skill](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent_Skill-555?logo=claude)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)\n[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kylehughes/the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill)](https://github.com/kylehughes/the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill/releases)\n\n*[The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/), packaged as a Skill for LLMs.*\n\n## About\n\nThe Unofficial Swift Programming Language Skill provides the complete content of [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) in the structured Skill format used by Claude.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n#### Personal Usage\n\nTo install this Skill for your personal use in Claude Code:\n\n1. Add the marketplace:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin marketplace add kylehughes/the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill\n   ```\n\n2. Install the Skill:\n   ```bash\n   /plugin install programming-swift-skill@the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill\n   ```\n\n#### Project Configuration\n\nTo automatically provide this Skill to everyone working in a repository, configure the repository's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"programming-swift-skill@the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill\": true\n  },\n  \"extraKnownMarketplaces\": {\n    \"the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"source\": \"github\",\n        \"repo\": \"kylehughes/the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen team members open the project, Claude Code will prompt them to install the Skill.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nYou can download the pre-packaged release for use in other environments (e.g. Claude Desktop).\n\n1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/kylehughes/the-unofficial-swift-programming-language-skill/releases) page.\n2. Download the `programming-swift.zip` file from the latest release.\n3. Import the Skill into your environment (e.g. ask Claude how).\n\nThe raw Skill content is also available in this repository's `programming-swift` directory.\n\n## Releases\n\nThis Skill is automatically updated nightly to match the official documentation. A new version is released only when the upstream content changes.\n\nVersion numbers follow the format `SWIFT_VERSION-YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `6.2.1-2025-11-21`).\n\n## Development\n\n### Build from Source\n\nYou can generate the Skill package locally using the provided Python script. The script has no external dependencies and is what is used to generate the pre-packaged releases.\n\n```bash\npython3 package.py\n```\n\nThis will clone the official repository and generate a `programming-swift` directory and `programming-swift.zip` archive in your current working directory.\n\n### Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| `--output DIR`, `-o DIR` | Specify output directory (default: `./programming-swift`) |\n| `--keep-temp` | Do not delete the temporary git clone after packaging |\n| `--dry-run` | Simulate operations without writing files |\n\n## Contributions\n\nThe Unofficial Swift Programming Language Skill is not accepting source contributions at this time. Bug reports will be considered.\n\n## Author\n\n[Kyle Hughes](https://kylehugh.es)\n\n[![Bluesky][bluesky_image]][bluesky_url]  \n[![LinkedIn][linkedin_image]][linkedin_url]  \n[![Mastodon][mastodon_image]][mastodon_url]\n\n[bluesky_image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Bluesky-0285FF?logo=bluesky&logoColor=fff\n[bluesky_url]: https://bsky.app/profile/kylehugh.es\n[linkedin_image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2?logo=linkedin&logoColor=fff\n[linkedin_url]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-hughes\n[mastodon_image]: https://img.shields.io/mastodon/follow/109356914477272810?domain=https%3A%2F%2Fmister.computer&style=social\n[mastodon_url]: https://mister.computer/@kyle\n\n## License & Attribution\n\nThe Unofficial Swift Programming Language Skill is available under the **MIT License**.
