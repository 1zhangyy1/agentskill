For advanced setup or the standalone version, visit the [main PAI repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure).\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What is PAI?\n\n> **Core Mission:** Augment humans with AI capabilities so they can survive and thrive in a world full of AI.\n\n**It doesn't matter how powerful AI becomes if it's not accessible to everyone.**\n\nRight now, AI is trapped behind corporate APIs, expensive subscriptions, and complex interfaces that only developers can use. Meanwhile, billions of people who could benefit from AI augmentation—artists, teachers, small business owners, researchers, parents—are left behind.\n\n**PAI exists to solve this.** This project's goal is to give the most powerful AI capabilities, in the form of a complete platform, to everyone on Earth.\n\n### What You Get\n\nPAI is your **personal AI that actually knows you**—all your projects, your style, your data—and can handle anything you throw at it. Whether you're an artist transitioning to independence, a founder building a company, or someone managing complex life needs, PAI becomes whatever you need it to be.\n\n**PAI is an open-source, full personal AI platform that's completely agnostic to who you are and what you're trying to accomplish.**\n\n### Real Capabilities\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n### 💼 Professional\n\n**Content Creation**\n- Write blog posts in your style\n- Publish directly to production\n- Enhance existing content\n\n**Business Analytics**\n- Newsletter metrics tracking\n- Website performance analysis\n- Client deliverables generation\n\n**Development**\n- Code analysis and review\n- Browser automation setup\n- API infrastructure management\n\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n### 🏠 Personal Life\n\n**Financial Intelligence**\n- Analyze bank statements\n- Track spending patterns\n- Parse PDFs for bills/expenses\n\n**Memory & Conversations**\n- Search recorded meetings\n- Query conversation history\n- Find event discussions\n\n**Health Tracking**\n- Monitor wellness metrics\n- Track medical records\n- Analyze sleep/fitness data\n\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\" valign=\"top\">\n\n### 🔬 Research & Learning\n\n**Knowledge Capture**\n- Extract insights from content\n- Document learnings\n- Deep web investigations\n\n**Communication**\n- Automated email outreach\n- SMS notifications\n- Team messaging integration\n\n**Productivity**\n- Task management\n- Idea visualization\n- Context-aware information access\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start (Plugin Installation)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n**1. Get Claude Code**\n\nVisit https://claude.ai/code to get Claude Code (Anthropic's official AI CLI).\n\n**2. Install Bun Runtime**\n\n```bash\nbrew install oven-sh/bun/bun\n```\n\n### Install PAI Plugin\n\n**Option 1: One-Command Install (Easiest)**\n\n```bash\nclaude-code plugin install github:danielmiessler/PAIPlugin\n```\n\n**Option 2: Manual Install**\n\n```bash\n# Clone the plugin\ngit clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAIPlugin.git ~/.claude/plugins/PAI\n\n# Run setup\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/PAI\n./setup.sh\n```\n\n### Configure\n\n```bash\n# Create environment file\ncp ~/.claude/.env.example ~/.claude/.env\n\n# Add your API keys (optional - for research agents)\nvim ~/.claude/.env\n```\n\n### Launch\n\nOpen Claude Code and start using your Personal AI Infrastructure!\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 Why PAI is Different\n\n> *This system is designed from the very beginning to be available to anybody and to grow and scale with you throughout your life.*\n\n- **🔓 Open Framework**: No vendor lock-in, complete transparency, you own everything\n- **🌍 Universal**: Works for anyone, anywhere, in any profession or life situation\n- **🤖 Platform Independent**: Core structure works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any AI platform\n- **🧠 Persistent Memory**: Your AI remembers every context, project, and conversation\n- **🎯 Task Agnostic**: From writing a blog to tracking medical data to running a business\n- **📁 Plain Text**: All configuration in human-readable files you can edit and understand\n- **🔌 Extensible**: Add your own skills, agents, and integrations\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Architecture\n\nPAI is built on four core primitives that work together:\n\n**💡 Skills** - Meta-containers for domain expertise\n- Package workflows, knowledge, and procedural guidance\n- Auto-load based on natural language triggers\n- Progressive disclosure prevents context bloat\n\n**⚡ Workflows** - Discrete task workflows within Skills\n- Self-contained, step-by-step workflows in `workflows/` subdirectories\n- Auto-selected by natural language or invoked explicitly\n- Like \"exported functions\" from a Skill module\n\n**🤖 Agents** - Orchestration workers for parallelization\n- Enable parallel execution of independent tasks\n- Primarily invoke Skills/Workflows (not standalone knowledge bases)\n- Best for background work where results are logged\n\n**🔌 MCPs vs Direct Code** - Implementation flexibility\n- Use MCPs for standardized platform services\n- Use direct API code for domain-specific integrations\n\n### How They Work Together\n\n```\nUser Intent → Natural Language Trigger\n    ↓\nSKILL (Container for Domain)\n    ↓\nWORKFLOW (Specific Task)\n    ↓\nImplementation (Direct Code or MCPs)\n    ↑\nInvoked by AGENTS (for parallelization)\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Do extensive research on AI agent planning\"\n  ↓\nResearch Skill loads\n  ↓\nworkflows/extensive-research.md selected\n  ↓\nLaunches 24 parallel researcher agents\n  ↓\nResults consolidated and saved\n```\n\n📖 **[Read the full architecture documentation](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Included Skills\n\n| Skill | What It Does | Example Usage |\n|:------|:-------------|:--------------|\n| **🔍 research** | Multi-source research with parallel agents | \"Research quantum computing trends\" |\n| **🧵 fabric** | 242+ AI patterns (threat modeling, summarization, extraction) | \"Create a threat model for our API\" |\n| **💻 development** | Full-stack development with architect and engineer agents | \"Build a meditation timer app\" |\n| **🎨 design** | UX/UI design with shadcn/ui and Figma integration | \"Design a dashboard for analytics\" |\n| **🔒 ffuf** | Web fuzzing for penetration testing | \"Test this API for vulnerabilities\" |\n| **📊 alex-hormozi-pitch** | Create irresistible offers using $100M Offers framework | \"Create a pitch for my SaaS product\" |\n| **🌐 web-scraping** | Extract data from websites (BrightData + Apify) | \"Scrape product listings from this site\" |\n| **📖 ref-documentation** | Search technical docs (React, Next.js, 100+ frameworks) | \"How do I use React hooks?\" |\n| **▶️ youtube-extraction** | Extract transcripts and content from YouTube videos | \"Summarize this YouTube video\" |\n| **🎭 webapp-testing** | Browser automation and visual testing | \"Test the login flow\" |\n\n---\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\n| Guide | Purpose | Time |\n|-------|---------|------|\n| [Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Understand how PAI works | 15 min |\n| [Migration Guide](./docs/MIGRATION.md) | Upgrade to v1.2.0 | 10 min |\n| [Full PAI README](./docs/PAI-README.md) | Complete documentation | 20 min |\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Recent Updates\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> **🔥 v1.2.0 -
