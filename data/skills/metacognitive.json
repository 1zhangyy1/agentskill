  "readme": "# 🧠 Claude Metacognitive Skill: Frosty\n\nThis repository contains a specialized prompt or set of instructions designed to enhance Claude's metacognitive abilities, allowing it to better **plan, monitor, and evaluate** its own reasoning processes for improved output quality and reliability.\n\n## ✨ What Does This Skill Do?\n\n* **[Briefly explain the primary benefit, e.g.,]** It forces Claude to use a three-step internal process (Deconstruct, Solve, Reflect) before providing the final answer.\n* **[Explain the outcome, e.g.,]** Reduces hallucination rates by requiring internal error checking.\n* **[Mention a specific use case, e.g.,]** Ideal for complex analysis, coding tasks, or multi-step problem-solving.\n\n## 🛠️ How to Implement and Use\n\nUsing this skill is as simple as copying the text and prepending it to your regular Claude prompts.\n\n### Step 1: Initialization\n\nCopy the entire metacognitive instruction block (found in `skill-instructions.txt` or similar file) and paste it into the **System Prompt** field or at the very beginning of a new conversation with Claude.\n\n### Step 2: Prompting\n\nOnce the instructions are loaded, submit your task.\n\n#### Example Input Prompt:\n\n> \"I need a concise summary of the key differences between quantum entanglement and quantum tunneling, written for a high school student.\"\n\n### Step 3: Observation\n\nClaude will now apply the structured internal reasoning defined by the skill before presenting its final response.\n\n## 📜 Source Code and Instructions\n\nThe core metacognitive skill text is located here:\n\n* [`claude-skill.txt`](./claude-skill.txt) - *[Link this to the file containing your actual prompt/skill]*\n\n## ⚖️ License and Attribution\n\nThis project is licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) License**.\n\n### Key License Requirements:\n\n1.  **Attribution:** You must always give appropriate credit to the original developer.\n2.  **Non-Commercial:** You may not use this work for commercial purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Original Developer & Attribution**\n\nThis Claude Metacognitive Skill was developed by ** Dr. Aneesh Joseph**.\n\nIf you use or adapt this skill, please ensure you clearly attribute the source by including a link back to this repository.\n\n---\n\n## 🤝 Contribution & Feedback\n\nWhile this skill is shared for free use, it is not currently open for external contributions. However, I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement! Please open an issue if you encounter unexpected behavior or have ideas for enhancement.",
